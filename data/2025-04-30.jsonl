To illustrate the practical potential of agentic\nsystems, we present a proof-of-concept application: a multi-agent framework for\nautomated essay scoring.

In this review, we\nexplore the emerging landscape of AI awareness, which includes meta-cognition\n(the ability to represent and reason about its own state), self-awareness\n(recognizing its own identity, knowledge, limitations, inter alia), social\nawareness (modeling the knowledge, intentions, and behaviors of other agents),\nand situational awareness (assessing and responding to the context in which it\noperates).\n  First, we draw on insights from cognitive science, psychology, and\ncomputational theory to trace the theoretical foundations of awareness and\nexamine how the four distinct forms of AI awareness manifest in\nstate-of-the-art AI. Next, we systematically analyze current evaluation methods\nand empirical findings to better understand these manifestations.

We hypothesize that\nwhile adversarial noise perturbs various regions of an image, edges may remain\nrelatively stable and provide essential structural information for\nclassification. To test this, we conducted a series of experiments using brain\ntumor and COVID datasets.

Retraining on a combination of\nclean and noisy images led to improved performance. To evaluate the robustness\nof the edge features, we extracted edges from the original/clean images and\ntrained the models exclusively on edge-based representations. When noise was\nintroduced to the images, the edge-based models demonstrated greater resilience\nto adversarial attacks compared to those trained on the original or clean\nimages. These results suggest that while adversarial noise is able to exploit\ncomplex non-edge regions significantly more than edges, the improvement in the\naccuracy after retraining is marginally more in the original data as compared\nto the edges.

Efficacy of Iterative Human-Driven Prompt Refinement in Image Regeneration Tasks", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV", "cs.HC"], "comment": null, "summary": "With AI-generated content becoming ubiquitous across the web, social media,\nand other digital platforms, it is vital to examine how such content are\ninspired and generated. The creation of AI-generated images often involves\nrefining the input prompt iteratively to achieve desired visual outcomes. This\nstudy focuses on the relatively underexplored concept of image regeneration\nusing AI, in which a human operator attempts to closely recreate a specific\ntarget image by iteratively refining their prompt. Image regeneration is\ndistinct from normal image generation, which lacks any predefined visual\nreference. A separate challenge lies in determining whether existing image\nsimilarity metrics (ISMs) can provide reliable, objective feedback in iterative\nworkflows, given that we do not fully understand if subjective human judgments\nof similarity align with these metrics. Consequently, we must first validate\ntheir alignment with human perception before assessing their potential as a\nfeedback mechanism in the iterative prompt refinement process. To address these\nresearch gaps, we present a structured user study evaluating how iterative\nprompt refinement affects the similarity of regenerated images relative to\ntheir targets, while also examining whether ISMs capture the same improvements\nperceived by human observers. Our findings suggest that incremental prompt\nadjustments substantially improve alignment, verified through both subjective\nevaluations and quantitative measures, underscoring the broader potential of\niterative workflows to enhance generative AI content creation across various\napplication domains."}

Biometric solutions offer potential for\nchild protection by helping to prevent baby swaps, locate missing children, and\nsupport national identity systems. However, developing effective biometric\nidentification systems for newborns remains a major challenge due to the\nphysiological variability caused by finger growth, weight changes, and skin\ntexture alterations during early development. Current literature has attempted\nto address these issues by applying scaling factors to emulate growth-induced\ndistortions in minutiae maps, but such approaches fail to capture the complex\nand non-linear growth patterns of infants. A key barrier to progress in this\ndomain is the lack of comprehensive, longitudinal biometric datasets capturing\nthe evolution of neonatal fingerprints over time. This study addresses this gap\nby focusing on designing and developing a high-quality biometric database of\nneonatal fingerprints, acquired at multiple early life stages. The dataset is\nintended to support the training and evaluation of machine learning models\naimed at emulating the effects of growth on biometric features.

To bridge the gap, we\npropose an offline simulation framework to curate a software-specific skillset,\na collection of verified scripts, by exploiting LLMs and publicly available\nscripting guides. Our framework comprises two components: (1) task creation,\nusing top-down functionality guidance and bottom-up API synergy exploration to\ngenerate helpful tasks; and (2) skill generation with trials, refining and\nvalidating scripts based on execution feedback.

We hypothesize that\nwhile adversarial noise perturbs various regions of an image, edges may remain\nrelatively stable and provide essential structural information for\nclassification. To test this, we conducted a series of experiments using brain\ntumor and COVID datasets. Initially, we trained the models on clean images and\nthen introduced subtle adversarial perturbations, which caused deep learning\nmodels to significantly misclassify the images. Retraining on a combination of\nclean and noisy images led to improved performance. To evaluate the robustness\nof the edge features, we extracted edges from the original/clean images and\ntrained the models exclusively on edge-based representations. When noise was\nintroduced to the images, the edge-based models demonstrated greater resilience\nto adversarial attacks compared to those trained on the original or clean\nimages. These results suggest that while adversarial noise is able to exploit\ncomplex non-edge regions significantly more than edges, the improvement in the\naccuracy after retraining is marginally more in the original data as compared\nto the edges.

The framework comprises three key components: a View\nPartition (VP) module, which uses the head-to-body ratio to group views by\naltitude; an Order-aware Feature Decoupling (OFD) module, which disentangles\naction-relevant and view-specific features under partial order guidance; and an\nAction Partial Order Guide (APOG), which leverages the partial order to\ntransfer informative knowledge from easier views to support learning in more\nchallenging ones. We conduct experiments on Drone-Action, MOD20, and UAV\ndatasets, demonstrating that POG-MVNet significantly outperforms competing\nmethods. For example, POG-MVNet achieves a 4.7% improvement on Drone-Action\ndataset and a 3.5% improvement on UAV dataset compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods ASAT and FAR. The code for POG-MVNet will be made available soon."}

This\nmodel has strong generalization capabilities, does not rely on predefined\nclasses, and adapts to diverse objects; however, it is pre-trained on natural\nimages and lacks the ability to process medical data effectively. In addition,\nthis model is built for 2D images, whereas a whole medical domain is based on\n3D images, such as CT and MRI. Recent adaptations of SAM for medical imaging\nare based on 2D models, thus requiring one prompt per slice to segment 3D\nobjects, making the segmentation process tedious. They also lack important\nfeatures such as editing. To bridge this gap, we propose RadSAM, a novel method\nfor segmenting 3D objects with a 2D model from a single prompt. In practice, we\ntrain a 2D model using noisy masks as initial prompts, in addition to bounding\nboxes and points. We then use this novel prompt type with an iterative\ninference pipeline to reconstruct the 3D mask slice-by-slice. We introduce a\nbenchmark to evaluate the model's ability to segment 3D objects in CT images\nfrom a single prompt and evaluate the models' out-of-domain transfer and\nedition capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art models on this benchmark using the AMOS abdominal organ\nsegmentation dataset."}

Yo'Chameleon is trained with\n(i) a self-prompting optimization mechanism to balance performance across\nmultiple modalities, and (ii) a ``soft-positive\" image generation approach to\nenhance image quality in a few-shot setting."}

The creation of AI-generated images often involves\nrefining the input prompt iteratively to achieve desired visual outcomes. This\nstudy focuses on the relatively underexplored concept of image regeneration\nusing AI, in which a human operator attempts to closely recreate a specific\ntarget image by iteratively refining their prompt. Image regeneration is\ndistinct from normal image generation, which lacks any predefined visual\nreference. A separate challenge lies in determining whether existing image\nsimilarity metrics (ISMs) can provide reliable, objective feedback in iterative\nworkflows, given that we do not fully understand if subjective human judgments\nof similarity align with these metrics.

In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral topological dynamics model to fold complex clothing. By utilizing the\nvisible folding structure as the topological skeleton, we design a novel\ntopological graph to represent the clothing state. This topological graph is\nlow-dimensional and applied for complex clothing in various folding states. It\nindicates the constraints of clothing and enables predictions regarding\nclothing movement. To extract graphs from self-occlusion, we apply semantic\nsegmentation to analyze the occlusion relationships and decompose the clothing\nstructure. The decomposed structure is then combined with keypoint detection to\ngenerate the topological graph. To analyze the behavior of the topological\ngraph, we employ an improved Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the general\ndynamics. The GNN model can predict the deformation of clothing and is employed\nto calculate the deformation Jacobi matrix for control.

We\ndemonstrate that simple standalone arithmetic tasks can effectively trigger\nthis vulnerability, and the prompts based on such tasks exhibit simpler logical\nstructures than mathematical word problems. We develop a systematic approach to\nefficiently collect attack prompts and an adaptive token compression framework\nthat utilizes LLMs to automatically compress these prompts.

Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through\nexperience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address\nbias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a\nwell-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity\nor limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge\nin the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method,\ncalled Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high\nplasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our\nBOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual\nclassifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be\nintegrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for\ntransferring knowledge across the two classifiers.

Code: https://github.com/mardgui/C2B", "summary": "A person downloading a pre-trained model from the web should be aware of its\nbiases. Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing\nlabels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have\naccess to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly\nlimits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work,\nwe present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that\nworks without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual\ndescription of the classification task to identify biases in the target\nclassification model. This description is fed to a large language model to\ngenerate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together\nwith task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those\ncaptions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the\ngiven biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no\nconstraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model\non any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show\nthat C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms\na recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific\nannotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic\nunsupervised bias detection."}

Distinguishing between heuristic-based human\nadaptation and rule-based AI search, we model interactions across modular\n(parallel) and sequenced (interdependent) tasks using an NK model. Our results\nreveal that in modular tasks, AI often substitutes for humans - delivering\nhigher payoffs unless human expertise is very high, and the AI search space is\neither narrowly focused or extremely broad. In sequenced tasks, interesting\ncomplementarities emerge. When an expert human initiates the search and AI\nsubsequently refines it, aggregate performance is maximized. Conversely, when\nAI leads, excessive heuristic refinement by the human can reduce payoffs. We\nalso show that even \"hallucinatory\" AI - lacking memory or structure - can\nimprove outcomes when augmenting low-capability humans by helping escape local\noptima. These results yield a robust implication: the effectiveness of AI-human\ncollaboration depends less on context or industry, and more on the underlying\ntask structure. By elevating task decomposition as the central unit of\nanalysis, our model provides a transferable lens for strategic decision-making\ninvolving humans and an agentic AI across diverse organizational settings."}

Unlike past technologies, the black box nature\nof generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing,\none in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system,\nleveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful\noutputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health\nharms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary\nto effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models\ndo not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized -- one less\nvisible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental\nhealth and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this\npaper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers is a\ncritical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health\nimpacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential\nindividual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these\nneeds, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers.
