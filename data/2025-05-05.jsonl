This creates challenges in designing software\narchitectures and task decision-making algorithms, as different contexts may\nrequire distinct task logic and architectural configurations. To address this,\nrobotic systems can be designed as self-adaptive systems capable of adapting\ntheir task execution and software architecture at runtime based on their\ncontext.This paper introduces ROSA, a novel knowledge-based framework for RObot\nSelf-Adaptation, which enables task-and-architecture co-adaptation (TACA) in\nrobotic systems. ROSA achieves this by providing a knowledge model that\ncaptures all application-specific knowledge required for adaptation and by\nreasoning over this knowledge at runtime to determine when and how adaptation\nshould occur. In addition to a conceptual framework, this work provides an\nopen-source ROS 2-based reference implementation of ROSA and evaluates its\nfeasibility and performance in an underwater robotics application.

This challenge arises primarily\nfrom two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text\ngeneration are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively\nmitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as\nsemantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can\naccurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to\nconsider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This\nphenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate\nwords and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising\nthe semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and\ndiminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm,\ncharacter-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding\nalgorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's\nproperties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's\nproperties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate\nwords in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the\ncharacter level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while\nreducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the\ncandidate pool. Furthermore, to ensure the effective transformation of\nsensitive information in long sequences, we also introduce the XLNet model.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the combination of CDEA and XLNet\nsignificantly improves the quality of generated steganographic text,\nparticularly in terms of perceptual-imperceptibility."}

Current model editing techniques, however, typically\noverlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised\nmodel performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this\nissue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in\nmulti-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT,\nspecifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this\nfoundation, we propose BalancEdit, a novel method for balanced model editing\nthat dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality.\nBalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and\nnegative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and\nincorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete,\nlocalized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To\nour knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the\ngenerality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive\nresults confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal\ntrade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset\nwill be available."}

However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations\nthat are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios\noften diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to\ngenerate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value\nPortrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value\norientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of\nitems that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of\nassessment results to real-world LLM usage and thus ecological validity.\nSecond, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their\nown thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual\nvalue scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that\nitems strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for\nassessing those values.

While fine-tuning is the standard\nadaptation method, specializing these models for challenging fine-grained\ndomains necessitates careful consideration of feature granularity. The critical\nquestion remains: how deeply should the pre-trained backbone be fine-tuned to\noptimize for the specialized task without incurring catastrophic forgetting of\nthe original general capabilities? Addressing this, we present a systematic\nempirical study evaluating the impact of fine-tuning depth. We adapt a standard\nYOLOv8n model to a custom, fine-grained fruit detection dataset by\nprogressively unfreezing backbone layers (freeze points at layers 22, 15, and\n10) and training. Performance was rigorously evaluated on both the target fruit\ndataset and, using a dual-head evaluation architecture, on the original COCO\nvalidation set. Our results demonstrate unequivocally that deeper fine-tuning\n(unfreezing down to layer 10) yields substantial performance gains (e.g., +10\\%\nabsolute mAP50) on the fine-grained fruit task compared to only training the\nhead. Strikingly, this significant adaptation and specialization resulted in\nnegligible performance degradation (<0.1\\% absolute mAP difference) on the COCO\nbenchmark across all tested freeze levels. We conclude that adapting\nmid-to-late backbone features is highly effective for fine-grained\nspecialization.

To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn\nto perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering\ninformation from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the\ntask, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the\nagent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete\ncreation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept\nto their implementation and deployment. We aim to contribute to research in\nEmbodied AI and autonomous agents, in order to foster future work in this\nfield. We present a detailed analysis of the procedure behind implementing an\nintelligent embodied agent, comprehending a thorough description of the current\nstate-of-the-art in literature, technical explanations of the proposed methods,\nand accurate experimental studies on relevant robotic tasks."}

Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate\nadversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and\nstructure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the\nreverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency\ncomponents of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding\nparts of the adversarial image. For the phase spectrum, we project the phase of\nthe estimated image into a designated range of the adversarial image's phase\nspectrum, focusing on the low frequencies.

While fine-tuning is the standard\nadaptation method, specializing these models for challenging fine-grained\ndomains necessitates careful consideration of feature granularity. The critical\nquestion remains: how deeply should the pre-trained backbone be fine-tuned to\noptimize for the specialized task without incurring catastrophic forgetting of\nthe original general capabilities? Addressing this, we present a systematic\nempirical study evaluating the impact of fine-tuning depth. We adapt a standard\nYOLOv8n model to a custom, fine-grained fruit detection dataset by\nprogressively unfreezing backbone layers (freeze points at layers 22, 15, and\n10) and training. Performance was rigorously evaluated on both the target fruit\ndataset and, using a dual-head evaluation architecture, on the original COCO\nvalidation set. Our results demonstrate unequivocally that deeper fine-tuning\n(unfreezing down to layer 10) yields substantial performance gains (e.g., +10\\%\nabsolute mAP50) on the fine-grained fruit task compared to only training the\nhead. Strikingly, this significant adaptation and specialization resulted in\nnegligible performance degradation (<0.1\\% absolute mAP difference) on the COCO\nbenchmark across all tested freeze levels. We conclude that adapting\nmid-to-late backbone features is highly effective for fine-grained\nspecialization. Critically, our results demonstrate this adaptation can be\nachieved without the commonly expected penalty of catastrophic forgetting,\npresenting a compelling case for exploring deeper fine-tuning strategies,\nparticularly when targeting complex domains or when maximizing specialized\nperformance is paramount."}

A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence,\nwhich places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision\nMaking, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to\nfoster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in\nsociety. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for\nphotorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of\nlearning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their\nbehavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms. These\nintelligent agents are intended to perform a certain task in a possibly unknown\nenvironment. To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn\nto perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering\ninformation from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the\ntask, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the\nagent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete\ncreation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept\nto their implementation and deployment.

Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF\nachieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP\n(10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation\nreduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly\nenhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all\ndevices.

However, HFL remains vulnerable to\nadversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly\ncompromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic\nvehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL\narchitecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient\nascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment\nfor each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and\nanomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity\nanalyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional\ndeviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive\nthresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric,\ndynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each\nvehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing\nvehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented,\nwhich assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy\nvehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency\ncheck is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple\ncompromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms\nform a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions\neffectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly\nreduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and\n3-hop topologies."}
