However, while performance gains remain the gold\nstandard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness\nare frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key\nresearch questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality\ncon-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping\nfairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in\nmultimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at\ninference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both\nperformance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new\nmodalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal\nmodels, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation\nmeasures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference\ndegrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in\nreal-world deployment.

To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments\n-- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must\naugment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting\na modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge\nthe gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence\nrequired for real-world problem-solving."}

Given the\npractical challenges associated with acquiring paired MRI and CT scans, the\ndevelopment of robust methods capable of leveraging unpaired datasets is\nessential for advancing the MRI-to-CT translation. Current unpaired MRI-to-CT\ntranslation methods, which predominantly rely on cycle consistency and\ncontrastive learning frameworks, frequently encounter challenges in accurately\ntranslating anatomical features that are highly discernible on CT but less\ndistinguishable on MRI, such as bone structures. This limitation renders these\napproaches less suitable for applications in radiation therapy, where precise\nbone representation is essential for accurate treatment planning. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a path- and bone-contour regularized approach for\nunpaired MRI-to-CT translation.

The optimal\nmapping is obtained by minimizing the transition path length of the flow. To\nenhance the accuracy of translated bone structures, we introduce a trainable\nneural network to generate bone contours from MRI and implement mechanisms to\ndirectly and indirectly encourage the model to focus on bone contours and their\nadjacent regions.

A hurdle for event-based VFI is how to effectively deal\nwith non-linear motion, caused by the dynamic changes in motion direction and\nspeed within the scene. Existing methods either use events to estimate sparse\noptical flow or fuse events with image features to estimate dense optical flow.\nUnfortunately, motion errors often degrade the VFI quality as the continuous\nmotion cues from events do not align with the dense spatial information of\nimages in the temporal dimension. In this paper, we find that object motion is\ncontinuous in space, tracking local regions over continuous time enables more\naccurate identification of spatiotemporal feature correlations. In light of\nthis, we propose a novel continuous point tracking-based VFI framework, named\nTimeTracker. Specifically, we first design a Scene-Aware Region Segmentation\n(SARS) module to divide the scene into similar patches.

Our\nproject aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based\nsystem to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more\ntime to intervene.\n  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient\ninformation or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab\nresults.

We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to\nfuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D\ngeometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description\nin extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose\nestimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate\nthat our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods.

Finally, we develop a new network architecture for\nscript-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that relies on the use of a\ncross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the\nvisual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the\nadvanced performance of SD-VSum against state-of-the-art approaches for\nquery-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the\nliterature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are\nadapted to each user's needs about their content."}

Current methods use pose-guided or\nglobal motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial\nstructure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing\nadaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference\nvideo to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows\nfor variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject\nof the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity\nconsistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure\nadaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter,\na lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and\nconsistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance\nconsistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our\nobservations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to\nmotion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different\ntimesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike\nexisting methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly\nachieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with\ndiverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints.

CoGenAV is\ntrained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual\nsynchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using\nonly 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This\ncontrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures\nfundamental cross-modal correlations.

When\nutilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these\nrepresentations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate\n(WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition\n(VSR) with a WER of 22.0 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in\nnoisy environments by over 70%.

In this\nresearch note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes\noscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism\nbetween them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and\nthreshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold\nunits model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate\ninformation exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between\nthese two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical\nsystems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to\nHopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a\nspecific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems\ncan be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model,\nwhich also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible.\nNotably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction\nto the weight matrix of a Hopfield network.

A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common\nphenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users\nor items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with\npositive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such\nunfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of\ncounterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build\na causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score.\nDuring the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to\nmitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using\ncounterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the\nresults validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating\nprediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment\nbias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ\ncounterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs."}

Current methods use pose-guided or\nglobal motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial\nstructure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing\nadaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference\nvideo to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows\nfor variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject\nof the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity\nconsistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure\nadaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter,\na lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and\nconsistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance\nconsistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our\nobservations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to\nmotion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different\ntimesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike\nexisting methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly\nachieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with\ndiverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints.
