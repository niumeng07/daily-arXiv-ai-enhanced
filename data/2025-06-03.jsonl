State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "4 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables. Full paper is available at\n  arXiv:2503.21055", "summary": "Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps\ntransform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the\nsequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Yet,\nexisting work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly\nlearned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study\nprocedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change\ndescriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders.\nMoreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized\nfailure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if''\nscenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to\nunderstand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the\nprocedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on\nprocedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection,\nand more. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nstate-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant\nimprovements on multiple tasks."}

Nevertheless,existing methods struggle to unify these\ncapabilities due to their fundamental differences.In this paper, we present the\nVisual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), a unified framework for perception, reasoning,\nand control in real world. VeBrain reformulates robotic control into common\ntext-based MLLM tasks in the 2D visual space, thus unifying the objectives and\nmapping spaces of different tasks. Then, a novel robotic adapter is proposed to\nconvert textual control signals from MLLMs to motion policies of real robots.\nFrom the data perspective, we further introduce VeBrain-600k, a high-quality\ninstruction dataset encompassing various capabilities of VeBrain. In\nVeBrain-600k, we take hundreds of hours to collect, curate and annotate the\ndata, and adopt multimodal chain-of-thought(CoT) to mix the different\ncapabilities into a single conversation. Extensive experiments on 13 multimodal\nbenchmarks and 5 spatial intelligence benchmarks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of VeBrain to existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL.

Then, reprojection error is used to associate events with the\ntarget's trajectory, providing more data than traditional intersection methods.\nFinally, a target velocity decay model is employed to fit the data, enabling\naccurate motion measurements via ours multi-view data joint computation. In a\nlight gas gun fragment test, the proposed method showed a measurement deviation\nof 4.47% compared to the electromagnetic speedometer."}

These\nlimitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world\nenvironments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for\ncomputer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \\textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world\ncomputer manipulations.

We categorize these risks into two major classes based on\ntheir risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks.

Extensive experiments with multimodal\nagents on \\textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents\nconfront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios.

By\noptimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis\naberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced\nsharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea.

So far,\nefforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on\nimage-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions,\nplacing emphasis on the \"eyes\" of human perception while neglecting the \"ears\",\nnamely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static\ninteractions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally\nincorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of\nsimultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been\nexplored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific\nconstraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural\nconversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots\nwith \"eyes and ears\" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As\npart of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset,\nMultimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel\nmultimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model,\ntrained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in\nlong-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like\nsettings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and\nrespond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong\nperformance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its\npotential for advanced multimodal conversational agents."}

We introduce GraphPad, a\nmodifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task\nthrough API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the\nenvironment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad\nfor task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that\nremains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding\nof the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a\n+3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language\nmodel, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show\nthat allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more\ninformative representations without extra training or data collection."}

Building\nupon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human\nevaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM\nperformance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of\nhallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define\nhallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case\nmaterials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating\narguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method\nemploys an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and\ncompares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case\ntriples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct\nLLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply\nargument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3)\nrecognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared\nfactors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve\nhigh accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument\ngeneration tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of\nrelevant factors present in the cases.

To maintain\nclassifier performance under low-contrast images, histogram equalization (HE)\nis commonly used.

We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum\ntraining recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was\nconducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various\npractical application scenarios, including not only common report generation\ntasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead\nECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple\nECGs."}

To address\nthis, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework\nthat decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable\nrewards.

To tackle these\nissues, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack (HGBA), the first\nbackdoor attack specifically designed for HGNNs, introducing a novel\nrelation-based trigger mechanism that establishes specific connections between\na strategically selected trigger node and poisoned nodes via the backdoor\nmetapath. HGBA achieves efficient and stealthy backdoor injection with minimal\nstructural modifications and supports easy backdoor activation through two\nflexible strategies: Self-Node Attack and Indiscriminate Attack. Additionally,\nwe improve the ASR measurement protocol, enabling a more accurate assessment of\nattack effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGBA far surpasses\nmultiple state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in black-box settings,\nefficiently attacking HGNNs with low attack budgets.

To address this,\nwe propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the\nanimatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers,\nwhich offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less\nprone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over\ntime and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded\ntraining strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point\ntracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the\nvertex and texel level.

Our\nexperiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only\nthe first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight\nperformance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant.\nNotably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to\nless than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is\nvery small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis\nbased on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings.

So far,\nefforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on\nimage-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions,\nplacing emphasis on the \"eyes\" of human perception while neglecting the \"ears\",\nnamely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static\ninteractions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally\nincorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of\nsimultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been\nexplored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific\nconstraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural\nconversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots\nwith \"eyes and ears\" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As\npart of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset,\nMultimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel\nmultimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval.

Classical signal processing based approaches, such as\nminimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order\nstatistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural\nnetworks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often\nsuffer from high complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE\n(A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter\nvia the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel\nthrough a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear\nactivations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To\nenhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention\nencoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure.\nAdditionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible\ntrade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive\nsimulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE\nconsistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE\nacross a wide range of SNR conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its\nrank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance complexity\ntrade-off, redefining the standard for practical channel estimation methods."}

Extending text-to-image\ngeneration to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant\nchallenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the\nabsence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical\nimaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation\nthat combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language\npretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model\ntrained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared\nembedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation.

However, they often fail to produce\nsemantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations\nthat contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual\ncontradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled\nassociations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware\nprompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a\nsequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the\nsemantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while\nensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a\nlarge language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify\ncontradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original\nintent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information\nwith the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic\ncontrol and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual\ncontradictions.

We propose a modified attention mechanism incorporating a non-linear\ntransformation of the key vectors (K) using a mapping function, resulting in a\nnew set of key vectors (K'). This non-linear mapping enhances the\nrepresentational capacity of the attention mechanism, allowing the model to\nencode more complex feature interactions and accelerating convergence without\ncompromising performance.

By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on\nour established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial\nLLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial\nperformance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex,\ninpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability\nto HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in\nthe domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical\nLLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical\nexam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage."}

A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to\nfiltered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support\nscalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894\nlive-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant\nthrough multi-layer semantic filtering.

In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a\n15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack\nsuccess rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most\nLLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly\nsensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain\nvulnerable to disclosing other personal data.

This\nmodification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter\n$m$ from $\\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves\nacceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a,\ncounter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature.\nHowever, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in\nleaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3\n\\log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good\nruntime of $O(n^{k+1} \\log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic\non all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large\nnumber of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the\ncommonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$."}

To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based method called DIME to learn the\njoint distribution of multiple outcomes of medical treatments. We addresses\nthree challenges relevant in medical practice: (i)it is tailored to learn the\njoint interventional distribution of multiple medical outcomes, which enables\nreliable decision-making with uncertainty quantification rather than relying\nsolely on point estimates; (ii)it explicitly captures the dependence structure\nbetween outcomes; (iii)it can handle outcomes of mixed type, including binary,\ncategorical, and continuous variables.

A crucial\naspect of this process is the classification of the customer's intent.\nPresently, most intent classification models for customer care utilise only\ncustomer query for intent prediction. This may result in low-accuracy models,\nwhich cannot handle ambiguous queries. An ambiguous query like \"I didn't\nreceive my package\" could indicate a delayed order, or an order that was\ndelivered but the customer failed to receive it. Resolution of each of these\nscenarios requires the execution of very different sequence of steps. Utilizing\nadditional information, such as the customer's order delivery status, in the\nright manner can help identify the intent for such ambiguous queries. In this\npaper, we have introduced a context-aware NLU model that incorporates both, the\ncustomer query and contextual information from the customer's order status for\npredicting customer intent. A novel selective attention module is used to\nextract relevant context features. We have also proposed a multi-task learning\nparadigm for the effective utilization of different label types available in\nour training data.

STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a systematic methodology\nfor identifying how complex systems can become unsafe, leading to hazards.

Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an\nindependent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many\nspecies exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in\nsubtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships,\nTaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across\ndifferent taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class\nand Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at\nthe Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures\ncoarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors,\nfacilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for\nspecies-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate\ngeneration even with limited training samples per species. Extensive\nexperiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms\nexisting approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image\ngeneration.

To address this, we propose a stage-aware\nprompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a\nsequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the\nsemantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while\nensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a\nlarge language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify\ncontradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original\nintent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information\nwith the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic\ncontrol and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual\ncontradictions.

In this work,\nwe undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of\ntoken entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens\ninfluence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of\ntokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer\nthe model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy\npatterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the\nbase model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy\ntokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e.,\nforking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy\ngradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20\nrule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable\nto full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly\nsurpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71\non AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models,\nhighlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the\n80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These\nfindings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing\nthe high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our\nresults highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy\nperspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to\nfurther improve LLM reasoning."}
