Interestingly, many of these\nquestions can be formulated by encoding them into propositional formulas and\nthen asking for its number of models. With a growing interest in practical\nproblem-solving for tasks that involve model counting, the community\nestablished the Model Counting (MC) Competition in fall of 2019 with its first\niteration in 2020. The competition aims at advancing applications, identifying\nchallenging benchmarks, fostering new solver development, and enhancing\nexisting solvers for model counting problems and their variants. The first\niteration, brought together various researchers, identified challenges, and\ninspired numerous new applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive\noverview of the 2021-2023 iterations of the Model Counting Competition. We\ndetail its execution and outcomes. The competition comprised four tracks, each\nfocusing on a different variant of the model counting problem. The first track\ncentered on the model counting problem (MC), which seeks the count of models\nfor a given propositional formula. The second track challenged developers to\nsubmit programs capable of solving the weighted model counting problem (WMC).\nThe third track was dedicated to projected model counting (PMC). Finally, we\ninitiated a track that combined projected and weighted model counting (PWMC).\nThe competition continued with a high level of participation, with seven to\nnine solvers submitted in various different version and based on quite\ndiverging techniques."}

External\nvalidation used 1,015 independent FNAB images. Results: ThyroidEffi Basic\nachieved a macro F1 of 89.19\\% and AUCs of 0.98 (B2), 0.95 (B5), and 0.96 (B6)\non the internal test set. External validation yielded AUCs of 0.9495 (B2),\n0.7436 (B5), and 0.8396 (B6). ThyroidEffi Premium improved macro F1 to 89.77\\%.\nGrad-CAM highlighted key diagnostic regions, confirming interpretability. The\nsystem processed 1000 cases in 30 seconds, demonstrating feasibility on widely\naccessible hardware like a 12-core CPU. Conclusions: This work demonstrates\nthat high-accuracy, interpretable thyroid FNAB image classification is\nachievable with minimal computational demands."}

Experiments show that our source-free and training-free method\noutperforms state-of-the-art trained approach UOTA by 1.92% on the DomainNet\ndataset, achieves SOTA-comparable performance on datasets such as Office-Home,\nand surpasses other SF-OSDA methods. This not only validates the effectiveness\nof our proposed method but also highlights CLIP's strong zero-shot potential\nfor SF-OSDA tasks."}

TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image\ngeneration task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts\nsaliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large\nmultimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and\nintroduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate\nimage-text response maps.

Materials and Methods: We utilized\nreal-world healthcare data from the Missouri Cancer Registry and Research\nCenter, linking patient records from two independent sources using\nprobabilistic linkage as a baseline. A transformer-based model, RoBERTa, was\nfine-tuned for blocking using sentence embeddings. For matching, several\nlanguage models were experimented under fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,\nassessing their performance against ground truth labels.

While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking,\nit is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks\nand defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area\nremains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a\ncross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because\nof the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels\nand frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two\nrepresentations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel,\nwe first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame\nadversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a\ntwo-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the\ntarget region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a\ngradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event\nvoxels.

While extant literature focuses on human reluctance to follow\nalgorithmic advice, we reverse the perspective by investigating how AI agents\nbased on large language models (LLMs) assess and integrate human input. Our\nwork addresses a pressing managerial constraint: firms barred from deploying\nLLMs directly due to privacy concerns can still leverage them as mediating\ntools (for instance, anonymized outputs or decision pipelines) to guide\nhigh-stakes choices like pricing or discounts without exposing proprietary\ndata. Through a controlled prediction task, we analyze how an LLM-based AI\nagent weights human versus algorithmic predictions. We find that the AI system\nsystematically discounts human advice, penalizing human errors more severely\nthan algorithmic errors--a bias exacerbated when the agent's identity (human vs\nAI) is disclosed and the human is positioned second. These results reveal a\ndisconnect between AI-generated trust metrics and the actual influence of human\njudgment, challenging assumptions about equitable human-AI collaboration. Our\nfindings offer three key contributions. First, we identify a reverse algorithm\naversion phenomenon, where AI agents undervalue human input despite comparable\nerror rates.

To address this, we propose Ladder Shape-bias Representation\nSide-tuning (LSR-ST), a lightweight PEFT framework that enhances model\nrobustness by introducing shape-biased inductive priors. LSR-ST captures\nshape-aware features using a simple HDConv Block, which integrates large-kernel\nattention and residual learning.

We formalize this concept via\nInformation Bottleneck theory and advocate for it as a key PEFT objective.\nUnlike traditional NLP paradigms that focus on optimizing parameters and\nmemory, visual tasks require models that extract task-defined semantics, rather\nthan just relying on pre-encoded features.

Moreover, relying only on a single overall\nsatisfaction rating does not lead to a nuanced understanding of why certain\nexplanations are effective or not. To address this, we analyze a dataset of\ncounterfactual explanations that were evaluated by 206 human participants, who\nrated not only overall satisfaction but also seven explanatory criteria:\nfeasibility, coherence, complexity, understandability, completeness, fairness,\nand trust. Modeling overall satisfaction as a function of these criteria, we\nfind that feasibility (the actionability of suggested changes) and trust (the\nbelief that the changes would lead to the desired outcome) consistently stand\nout as the strongest predictors of user satisfaction, though completeness also\nemerges as a meaningful contributor.

In this work, we address this by\nintroducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with\nmultiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two\ndifferent perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically,\nwe first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into\nmultiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene\nrepresentation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting\ninstances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and\nboundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas. Then, we introduce\nanother multiplane representation that splits the scene in an instance-level\nperspective, and represents each instance with both matte and color.

Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and\nbackground content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like\nimage editing. Once built, the representation can be reused to realize\ncontrollable instance-level image editing with high efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments validate the clear advantage of MP-Mat in matting task.

We investigate two\nideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level.\nFirst, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques\nwith ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the\nbaseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads\nto two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is\ngained through full retraining may not be feasible through partial training.\n(2) This gain seems to depend on using a large and diverse dataset in\nquantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the\ntwo insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon\nApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. It\nrelies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the\nmost impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on benchmark\nlanguage models from the LLaMA family show that our proposed approach boosts\naccuracy and tightens the gap between the quantized model and the\nfull-precision model, with minimal overhead. Our method will be made publicly\navailable to facilitate future developments in ultra-low-bit quantization of\nlarge language models."}

We\nfurther demonstrate that hyperbolic tangent-like activation functions (odd,\nbounded, and continuous) preserve these oscillatory dynamics by ensuring motion\ninvariants in state space. Numerical simulations showcase how nonlinear\nactivation functions not only maintain limit cycles, but also enhance the\nnumerical stability of the system integration process, mitigating those\ninstabilities that are commonly associated with the forward Euler method. The\nexperimental results of this analysis highlight practical considerations for\ndesigning neural architectures capable of capturing complex temporal\ndependencies, i.e., strategies for enhancing memorization skills in recurrent\nmodels."}

At the same time, recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have\nbegun to reveal the internal processes that give rise to model outputs, raising\nthe question of whether models and humans might arrive at outputs using similar\n\"processing strategies\". Here, we investigate the link between real-time\nprocessing in humans and \"layer-time\" dynamics in Transformer models. Across\nfive studies spanning domains and modalities, we test whether the dynamics of\ncomputation in a single forward pass of pre-trained Transformers predict\nsignatures of processing in humans, above and beyond properties of the model's\noutput probability distribution.

TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized\nspatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information\nto lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera motion is\neffectively canceled. TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame 3D motion\nestimates within this stabilized representation, enabling robust tracking over\nextended periods. To manage the inherent irregularities of 3D point\ndistributions, we propose a Local Pair Attention mechanism.

A recent line of work proposes\nan abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is\nseen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates\nstrings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of\ncandidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the\nalgorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This\nformalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the\nalgorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should\nbe able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central\nin applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between\nhallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating\nonly a restricted set of outputs).

Multi-layer prompting integrates\ncategory-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general\nprompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By\ncombining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further\nenhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and\ngeneralization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a\nvision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while\na query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from\nboth branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across\nunseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering\nmechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered\nduring CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute\nto the final vision-language alignment."}

In this paper, we reframe RAG as a\nproblem of retrieval-aware reasoning and identify a core challenge: reasoning\nmisalignment-the mismatch between a model's reasoning trajectory and the\nretrieved evidence. To address this challenge, we propose AlignRAG, a novel\ntest-time framework that mitigates reasoning misalignment through iterative\nCritique-Driven Alignment (CDA) steps. In contrast to prior approaches that\nrely on static training or post-hoc selection, AlignRAG actively refines\nreasoning trajectories during inference by enforcing fine-grained alignment\nwith evidence. Our framework introduces a new paradigm for retrieval-aware\nreasoning by: (1) constructing context-rich training corpora; (2) generating\ncontrastive critiques from preference-aware reasoning trajectories; (3)\ntraining a dedicated \\textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} to identify reasoning\nmisalignments; and (4) applying CDA steps to optimize reasoning trajectories\niteratively. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignRAG consistently\noutperforms all baselines and could integrate as a plug-and-play module into\nexisting RAG pipelines without further changes.

Existing methods often\nstruggle to maintain accurate alignment, leading to noticeable discrepancies.\nTo address this issue, we propose \\name{}, a new framework that enhances\ncontrollable 3D generation by explicitly encouraging cyclic consistency between\nthe second-order 3D content, generated based on extracted signals from the\nfirst-order generation, and its original input controls. Specifically, we\nemploy an efficient feed-forward backbone that can generate a 3D object from an\ninput condition and a text prompt. Given an initial viewpoint and a control\nsignal, a novel view is rendered from the generated 3D content, from which the\nextracted condition is used to regenerate the 3D content. This re-generated\noutput is then rendered back to the initial viewpoint, followed by another\nround of control signal extraction, forming a cyclic process with two\nconsistency constraints. \\emph{View consistency} ensures coherence between the\ntwo generated 3D objects, measured by semantic similarity to accommodate\ngenerative diversity. \\emph{Condition consistency} aligns the final extracted\nsignal with the original input control, preserving structural or geometric\ndetails throughout the process.

These modalities are fused to create compact semantic node features.\nThe matching layers then search for correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner.\nIn the back-end, we employ a robust pose estimator to decide transformation\naccording to the correspondences. We manage to maintain a sparse and\nhierarchical scene representation. Our approach demands fewer GPU resources and\nfewer communication bandwidth in multi-agent tasks. Moreover, we design a new\ndata generation approach using vision foundation models and a semantic mapping\nmodule to reconstruct semantic scene graphs. It differs significantly from\nprevious works, which rely on ground-truth semantic annotations to generate\ndata. We validate our method in a two-agent SLAM benchmark. It significantly\noutperforms the hand-crafted baseline in terms of registration success rate.\nCompared to visual loop closure networks, our method achieves a slightly higher\nregistration recall while requiring only 52 KB of communication bandwidth for\neach query frame.

Despite the increasing\nregulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools\nfor systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM\nhas learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches\ntypically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image\nclassification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt\nuncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges,\nwe introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric\nconcept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection,\nPAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for\noptimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model\nand 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform.\nPAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by\n18-40x compared to existing baselines.

Building on these breakthroughs, code LLMs with\nadvanced coding capabilities bring huge impacts on software engineering,\nshowing the tendency to become an essential part of developers' daily routines.\nHowever, the current code LLMs still face serious challenges related to\ntrustworthiness, as they can generate incorrect, insecure, or unreliable code.\nRecent exploratory studies find that it can be promising to detect such risky\noutputs by analyzing LLMs' internal states, akin to how the human brain\nunconsciously recognizes its own mistakes. Yet, most of these approaches are\nlimited to narrow sub-domains of LLM operations and fall short of achieving\nindustry-level scalability and practicability. To address these challenges, in\nthis paper, we propose PtTrust, a two-stage risk assessment framework for code\nLLM based on internal state pre-training, designed to integrate seamlessly with\nthe existing infrastructure of software companies. The core idea is that the\nrisk assessment framework could also undergo a pre-training process similar to\nLLMs. Specifically, PtTrust first performs unsupervised pre-training on\nlarge-scale unlabeled source code to learn general representations of LLM\nstates. Then, it uses a small, labeled dataset to train a risk predictor. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PtTrust through fine-grained, code line-level\nrisk assessment and demonstrate that it generalizes across tasks and different\nprogramming languages.

This work addresses this\nlimitation by extending the $R^2$-Gaussian splatting framework to reconstruct\nanatomically consistent 3D volumes under these challenging conditions. We\nintroduce an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style\ntransfer, improving visual consistency across views, and enhancing\nreconstruction quality.

This well-defined narrow capability brings two nice benefits,\na clear criterion of success and the opportunity to collect a lot of examples.\nThe criteria not only reveal whether a machine has achieved a goal, but reveal\nhow the machine falls short of the goal. As a result, human designers can fix\nthe problems one after the other until the machine is deemed good enough for\nthe task. Furthermore, the large set of collected examples reduces the\ndifficulty of this problem-fixing process (by the central limit theorem).\n  Do the success in closed-world translate into broad open-world, where a\nmachine is required to perform any task that a human could possibly undertake\nwith fewer examples and less priori knowledge from human designers? No. Because\ncompetence in a specific task provides little insight in handling other tasks,\nthe valuable criteria for specific tasks become helpless when handling broader\nunseen tasks. Furthermore, due to the shortage of examples in unseen tasks,\ncentral limit theorem does not stand on our side. At the end, human designers\nlose the oscilloscope to \"hack\" an AI system for the open-world.\n  Achieving AI for the open-world requires unique learning principles and\ninnovated techniques, which are different from the ones in building AI for the\nclosed-world.

Despite the increasing\nregulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools\nfor systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM\nhas learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches\ntypically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image\nclassification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt\nuncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges,\nwe introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric\nconcept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection,\nPAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for\noptimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model\nand 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform.\nPAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by\n18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first\nscalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of\ndiffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more\ntransparent diffusion model sharing."}

Rehearsal-based approaches rely on knowledge distillation,\ncontinuously accumulating forgetting during the distillation process.\nRehearsal-free methods insufficiently learn the distribution of each domain,\nleading to forgetfulness over time. To solve these issues, we propose a novel\nDistribution-aware Forgetting Compensation (DAFC) model that explores\ncross-domain shared representation learning and domain-specific distribution\nintegration without using old exemplars or knowledge distillation. We propose a\nText-driven Prompt Aggregation (TPA) that utilizes text features to enrich\nprompt elements and guide the prompt model to learn fine-grained\nrepresentations for each instance. This can enhance the differentiation of\nidentity information and establish the foundation for domain distribution\nawareness. Then, Distribution-based Awareness and Integration (DAI) is designed\nto capture each domain-specific distribution by a dedicated expert network and\nadaptively consolidate them into a shared region in high-dimensional space. In\nthis manner, DAI can consolidate and enhance cross-domain shared representation\nlearning while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we develop a\nKnowledge Consolidation Mechanism (KCM) that comprises instance-level\ndiscrimination and cross-domain consistency alignment strategies to facilitate\nmodel adaptive learning of new knowledge from the current domain and promote\nknowledge consolidation learning between acquired domain-specific\ndistributions, respectively. Experimental results show that our DAFC\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LiuShiBen/DAFC."}

To overcome these\nlimitations, we present an integrated neuromorphic optical signal processor\n(OSP) that leverages deep reservoir computing and achieves DSP-free,\nall-optical, real-time processing. Experimentally, our OSP achieves a 100 Gbaud\nPAM4 per lane, 1.6 Tbit/s data center interconnect over a 5 km optical fiber in\nthe C-band (equivalent to over 80 km in the O-band), far exceeding the reach of\nstate-of-the-art DSP solutions, which are fundamentally constrained by\nchromatic dispersion in IMDD systems. Simultaneously, it reduces processing\nlatency by four orders of magnitude and energy consumption by three orders of\nmagnitude.

Human agents often encounter hard choices, that is, situations where\noptions are incommensurable; neither option is preferred, yet the agent is not\nindifferent between them. In such cases, human agents can identify hard choices\nand resolve them through deliberation.

However, the benefit of such long thoughts for\nsystem-2 reasoning is relatively less explored in other domains such as\nperceptual tasks where shallower, system-1 reasoning seems sufficient. In this\npaper, we introduce LongPerceptualThoughts, a new synthetic dataset with 30K\nlong-thought traces for perceptual tasks. The key challenges in synthesizing\nelaborate reasoning thoughts for perceptual tasks are that off-the-shelf models\nare not yet equipped with such thinking behavior and that it is not\nstraightforward to build a reliable process verifier for perceptual tasks.\nThus, we propose a novel three-stage data synthesis framework that first\nsynthesizes verifiable multiple-choice questions from dense image descriptions,\nthen extracts simple CoTs from VLMs for those verifiable problems, and finally\nexpands those simple thoughts to elaborate long thoughts via frontier reasoning\nmodels. In controlled experiments with a strong instruction-tuned 7B model, we\ndemonstrate notable improvements over existing visual reasoning data-generation\nmethods. Our model, trained on the generated dataset, achieves an average +3.4\npoints improvement over 5 vision-centric benchmarks, including +11.8 points on\nV$^*$ Bench.

The DXA images are separated into multiple regions of\ninterest (RoIs), such as the femoral head, shaft, and lesser trochanter.\nRadiomic features are then calculated for each RoI, with the central\ncoordinates used as nodes in a graph.

In this work, we address the challenge of\ngenerating photorealistic mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative\nmodels. Despite extensive training data, existing diffusion models frequently\noverlook the nuanced details crucial to authentic mirror reflections. Recent\napproaches have attempted to resolve this by creating synhetic datasets and\nframing reflection generation as an inpainting task; however, they struggle to\ngeneralize across different object orientations and positions relative to the\nmirror. Our method overcomes these limitations by introducing key augmentations\ninto the synthetic data pipeline: (1) random object positioning, (2) randomized\nrotations, and (3) grounding of objects, significantly enhancing generalization\nacross poses and placements. To further address spatial relationships and\nocclusions in scenes with multiple objects, we implement a strategy to pair\nobjects during dataset generation, resulting in a dataset robust enough to\nhandle these complex scenarios. Achieving generalization to real-world scenes\nremains a challenge, so we introduce a three-stage training curriculum to\ndevelop the MirrorFusion 2.0 model to improve real-world performance.

We test this prediction in three\nlarge-scale acceptability studies, using a super-additive design that singles\nout subject island violations, in three different constructions: wh-questions,\nrelative clauses, and topicalization. We report evidence for a subject island\neffect in each construction type, despite only wh-questions introducing what\nAbeill\\'e et al.

In recent\nyears, various deep learning methods have been explored for edge detection\ntasks resulting in a significant performance improvement compared to\nconventional computer vision algorithms. In neural networks, edge detection\ntasks require considerably large receptive fields to provide satisfactory\nperformance. In a typical convolutional operation, such a large receptive field\ncan be achieved by utilizing a significant number of consecutive layers, which\nyields deep network structures. Recently, a Multi-scale Tensorial Summation\n(MTS) factorization operator was presented, which can achieve very large\nreceptive fields even from the initial layers. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel MTS Dimensional Reduction (MTS-DR) module guided neural network,\nMTS-DR-Net, for the edge detection task. The MTS-DR-Net uses MTS layers, and\ncorresponding MTS-DR blocks as a new backbone to remove redundant information\ninitially. Such a dimensional reduction module enables the neural network to\nfocus specifically on relevant information (i.e., necessary subspaces).\nFinally, a weight U-shaped refinement module follows MTS-DR blocks in the\nMTS-DR-Net. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark edge detection\ndatasets: BSDS500 and BIPEDv2 to verify the effectiveness of our model.

To address this significant\nshortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding,\nwe propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the\nlong-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery\nthat the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global\nchannels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily\nresponsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the\nkey bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths\nlargely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit\nlimitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba's\npoor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the\nhidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the\naccumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first\nidentifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token\nfiltering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive\nbenchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba\nsets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly\nextending its operational range without requiring additional training.

However,\nour further experiments demonstrate that not all gradients from\nself-supervision tasks are beneficial and some may negatively impact the\nclassification performance. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, termed\nSaliency Map-based Data Sampling Block (SM-DSB), to mitigate these gradient\nconflicts. Specifically, our method designs a new scoring mechanism based on\nthe skewness of 3D saliency maps to estimate gradient conflicts without\nrequiring target labels. Leveraging this, we develop a sample selection\nstrategy that dynamically filters out samples whose self-supervision gradients\nare not beneficial for the classification. Our approach is scalable,\nintroducing modest computational overhead, and can be integrated into all the\npoint cloud UDA MTL frameworks.

Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively\ngenerate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. The strategy\nleverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model\nto guide the summary. Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one\nto generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it,\nand a third to optimise the prompt of the generator. This iteration is\nnecessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on\nthe generator prompt, and varies widely among videos.

We define the complete\nLLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training,\ndeployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the\nfirst safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive\nLiterature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over\n800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of\nsecurity issues within a more holistic understanding.

The onboard DL-based object detection and grasp\nclassification models achieved accuracies of 96% and 100% respectively. In the\nforce prediction, the mean absolute error was found to be 0.018. The features\nof the proposed prosthetic hand can thus be summarized as: a) a wrist-mounted\nmicro camera for artificial sensing, enabling a wide range of hand-based tasks;\nb) real-time object detection and distance estimation for precise grasping; and\nc) ultra-low-power operation that delivers high performance within constrained\npower and resource limits."}

While considerable\nliterature studies how humans trust AI agents, it is much less understood how\nLLM-based agents develop effective trust in humans. LLM-based agents likely\nrely on some sort of implicit effective trust in trust-related contexts (e.g.,\nevaluating individual loan applications) to assist and affect decision making.\nUsing established behavioral theories, we develop an approach that studies\nwhether LLMs trust depends on the three major trustworthiness dimensions:\ncompetence, benevolence and integrity of the human subject. We also study how\ndemographic variables affect effective trust. Across 43,200 simulated\nexperiments, for five popular language models, across five different scenarios\nwe find that LLM trust development shows an overall similarity to human trust\ndevelopment. We find that in most, but not all cases, LLM trust is strongly\npredicted by trustworthiness, and in some cases also biased by age, religion\nand gender, especially in financial scenarios. This is particularly true for\nscenarios common in the literature and for newer models. While the overall\npatterns align with human-like mechanisms of effective trust formation,\ndifferent models exhibit variation in how they estimate trust; in some cases,\ntrustworthiness and demographic factors are weak predictors of effective trust.\nThese findings call for a better understanding of AI-to-human trust dynamics\nand monitoring of biases and trust development patterns to prevent unintended\nand potentially harmful outcomes in trust-sensitive applications of AI."}

However,\ndespite their efficiency in handling long contexts, recent studies have shown\nthat SSMs, such as Mamba models, generally underperform compared to\nTransformers in long-context understanding tasks. To address this significant\nshortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding,\nwe propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the\nlong-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery\nthat the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global\nchannels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily\nresponsible for long-context capability.

The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the\nhidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the\naccumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first\nidentifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token\nfiltering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive\nbenchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba\nsets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly\nextending its operational range without requiring additional training. Our code\nis available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/LongMamba."}

Some research suggests that VLMs can exhibit humanlike\nscene understanding, while other investigations reveal difficulties in their\nability to process relational information. To achieve widespread applicability,\nVLMs must perform reliably, yielding comparable competence across a wide\nvariety of related tasks. We sought to test how reliable these architectures\nare at engaging in trivial spatial cognition, e.g., recognizing whether one\nobject is left of another in an uncluttered scene. We developed a benchmark\ndataset -- TableTest -- whose images depict 3D scenes of objects arranged on a\ntable, and used it to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs. Results show that\nperformance could be degraded by minor variations of prompts that use logically\nequivalent descriptions. These analyses suggest limitations in how VLMs may\nreason about spatial relations in real-world applications. They also reveal\nnovel opportunities for bolstering image caption corpora for more efficient\ntraining and testing."}

We\nintroduce the Describe Anything Model (DAM), a model designed for detailed\nlocalized captioning (DLC). DAM preserves both local details and global context\nthrough two key innovations: a focal prompt, which ensures high-resolution\nencoding of targeted regions, and a localized vision backbone, which integrates\nprecise localization with its broader context. To tackle the scarcity of\nhigh-quality DLC data, we propose a Semi-supervised learning (SSL)-based Data\nPipeline (DLC-SDP). DLC-SDP starts with existing segmentation datasets and\nexpands to unlabeled web images using SSL. We introduce DLC-Bench, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate DLC without relying on reference captions. DAM sets new\nstate-of-the-art on 7 benchmarks spanning keyword-level, phrase-level, and\ndetailed multi-sentence localized image and video captioning."}

A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense\nand Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently\nsolve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from\nsub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively\nact on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study\nwhy LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we\nclosely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and\nthe knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by\nfine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales.\nOur experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and\nTic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making\nabilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing\ngap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as\n$\\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and\nself-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for\ndecision-making."}
