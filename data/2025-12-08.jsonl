However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime.

Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead."}

We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics. Qualitatively, we observe almost no degradation in visual quality compared with full computations."}

Accurate identification of the culprit vessel and assessment of stenosis severity are essential for guiding individualized therapy. Although coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is the first-line non-invasive modality for CAD diagnosis, its dependence on high-end equipment, radiation exposure, and strict patient cooperation limits large-scale use. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities. Subgroup analyses across demographic and acquisition-time strata further confirmed model stability. Risk stratification based on vessel-specific incidence thresholds showed consistent separation on calibration and cumulative event curves. Interpretability analyses revealed distinct waveform differences between high- and low-risk groups, highlighting key electrophysiological regions contributing to model decisions and offering new insights into the ECG correlates of coronary stenosis."}

Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate \"AS-IS\" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved \"TO-BE\" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments. The results demonstrate that conversational LLMs can potentially be used to lower the skill and cost barriers to rigorous process documentation, helping SMEs preserve institutional knowledge, enhance operational transparency, and accelerate continuous-improvement efforts."}

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings."}

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods.

We introduce FlowEO, a novel framework that leverages generative models for image-space UDA in Earth observation. We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters.

So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence."}

Our method is iterative and has three stages: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments for each pair, removing the ones that do not match our expected quality levels, and (3) training on correct judge answers and their reasoning traces. We evaluate the resulting judge on Multimodal RewardBench and VL-RewardBench across domains: correctness, preference, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our method improves a Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 in overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, often outperforming much larger models including Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with particularly strong gains in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions.

Although CoT examples facilitate reasoning, we noticed that their excessive inclusion during meta-training degrades performance when CoT supervision is limited. To mitigate such behavior, we propose CoT-Recipe, a formal approach to modulate the mix of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. We demonstrate that careful modulation via CoT-Recipe can increase the accuracy of transformers on novel tasks by up to 300% even when there are no CoT examples available in-context.

These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by $100\\times$ with minor quality degradation.

This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs.

This paper attempts to introduce a concept of a tiered embedder in fine-grained image generation, which integrates semantic information from both super and child classes, allowing the diffusion model to better incorporate semantic information and address the issue of semantic entanglement. To address the issue of insufficient detail in fine-grained images, we introduce the concept of super-resolution during the perceptual information generation stage, enhancing the detailed features of fine-grained images through enhancement and degradation models.

This paper introduces a completely innovative architecture and concept: combining the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a specific clinical application, known as MCP-AI. This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers. The system connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines. MCP-AI provides a scalable basis for interpretable, composable, and safety-oriented AI within upcoming clinical environments."}

To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods. All codes are released."}

Our approach addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, using 100+ high-precision regex patterns to generate pseudo-labels for fine-tuning a multilingual BERT.

Applying this framework to a 1.47-million-word diachronic corpus, our ensemble achieves a 52.4% overall feature detection rate. Our findings reveal that Sanskrit's overall morphological complexity does not decrease but is instead dynamically redistributed: while earlier verbal features show cyclical patterns of decline, complexity shifts to other domains, evidenced by a dramatic expansion in compounding and the emergence of new philosophical terminology.

We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task."}

Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results."}

We formalize the verification problem, prove soundness of our approach, and evaluate BEAVER on correctness verification, privacy verification and secure code generation tasks across multiple state of the art LLMs. BEAVER achieves 6 to 8 times tighter probability bounds and identifies 3 to 4 times more high risk instances compared to baseline methods under identical computational budgets, enabling precise characterization and risk assessment that loose bounds or empirical evaluation cannot provide."}

In this work, a novel benchmark dataset designed to model human aesthetic judgments of image rendering styles is introduced: the Dataset for Evaluating the Aesthetics of Rendering (DEAR).

The data collection pipeline is described, human voting patterns are analyzed, and multiple use cases are outlined, including style preference prediction, aesthetic benchmarking, and personalized aesthetic modeling. To the best of the authors' knowledge, DEAR is the first dataset to systematically address image aesthetics of rendering assessment grounded in subjective human preferences.

However, these approaches either require additional test-time compute or assume access to more powerful teacher models, making them costly and less practical. In this work, we propose Self Critique and Refinement-based Preference Optimization (SCRPO), which is a self-supervised training framework that first constructs a preference dataset by leveraging the LLM's own critique and refinement capabilities, and then applies preference learning to improve the same LLM for faithful summarization. Experiments on three summarization benchmarks (XSUM CNNDM and SAMSum), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in terms of faithfulness metrics while either maintaining or improving other metrics that measure the overall quality of the summary.

To operationalize it, we introduce a preliminary version of the Akrasia Benchmark, currently a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline [B], Synonym [S], Temporal [T], and Temptation [X]) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments. The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of \"self-control\" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as \"scheming\" or deliberate misalignment.

To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), which is a unified data format for quantization and sparsification potentially easily supported by new hardware and existing GPUs. SQ-format makes use of the fact that sparse matrix can be accelerated in high-precision, and low-precision matrix multiplication can also be accelerated accordingly. As such, SQ-format is proposed to achieve Pareto improvement between performance and throughput. This format is particularly suitable for activations with outlier inequality status and makes their static compression possible.

While music information retrieval and computational musicology have explored structured and multimodal understanding, few resources support factual and contextual music question answering (MQA) grounded in artist metadata or historical context. We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus. We release MusWikiDB and ArtistMus to advance research in music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering, establishing a foundation for retrieval-augmented reasoning in culturally rich domains such as music."}

Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies."}

Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven."}

While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning.

In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions.

No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD.

We compared three supervised transformer-based encoders (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) against four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). We introduced a novel inference strategy using lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting to ground model reasoning. Performance was evaluated using class-specific F1-scores.\n  Results: The anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model achieved the highest performance, yielding an incidentaloma-positive macro-F1 of 0.79. This surpassed all supervised baselines (maximum macro-F1: 0.70) and closely matched the inter-annotator agreement of 0.76. Explicit anatomical grounding yielded statistically significant performance gains across GPT-based models (p < 0.05), while a majority-vote ensemble of the top systems further improved the macro-F1 to 0.90. Error analysis revealed that anatomy-aware LLMs demonstrated superior contextual reasoning in distinguishing actionable findings from benign lesions.\n  Conclusion: Generative LLMs, when enhanced with structured lesion tagging and anatomical context, significantly outperform traditional supervised encoders and achieve performance comparable to human experts.

Owing to computational and token-cost constraints, we evaluate a curated set of 100 representative problems across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants, under standard prompting, CoT, and ToT strategies. Our results show that CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% (standard prompting) to 83% on average, while ToT further increases performance by up to 5 percentage points, achieving 88% accuracy with GPT-OSS-120B.

To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual.

This set forms a rank space made up of multiple individual ranks, whose expressiveness directly shapes the model's adaptability. However, quantitative analysis reveals low-rank adaptation exhibits significant redundancy in the rank space, with many ranks contributing almost no practical information. This hinders the model's ability to learn more diverse knowledge to address the various challenges in RGB-T tracking. To address this issue, we propose the Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework for RGB-T tracking, which effectively leverages the rank space through structured parameter learning. Specifically, we adopt a rank decomposition partitioning strategy utilizing singular value decomposition to quantify rank importance, freeze crucial ranks to preserve the pretrained priors, and cluster the redundant ranks into groups to prepare for subsequent orthogonal constraints. We further design an inter-group orthogonal constraint strategy. This constraint enforces orthogonality between rank groups, compelling them to learn complementary features that target diverse challenges, thereby alleviating information redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets and validating its effectiveness in RGB-T tracking tasks."}

We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory).

MOA reports were quantitatively evaluated on 488 patients from the TCGA-LGG cohort against clinical and histology baselines. MOA without the histology tool outperformed the clinical baseline, achieving an F1-score of 0.826 compared to 0.798. When fused with histology features, MOA reached the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology baseline at 0.894 and the fused histology-clinical baseline at 0.897. These results demonstrate that the proposed agent captures complementary mutation-relevant information enriched through external biomedical sources, enabling accurate IDH1 mutation prediction."}

Although attention-based pruning methods are widely used to accelerate inference, trials at early decoder layers often result in significant performance degradation, especially under high compression rates. We argue that while attention-based pruning inherently holds the potential to identify the most relevant visual tokens, its effectiveness in shallow decoder layers is limited by factors such as positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction. In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based pruning framework, termed ShaRP, that integrates segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. It enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaRP achieves competitive performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for accelerating VLLM inference."}

A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet currently forces a critical trade-off: methods either sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features or fail to model dynamic problems due to static, non-interleaved structures. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning."}

However, estimating personalized networks typically requires intensive longitudinal data, which is not always feasible. A solution to facilitate scalability of network-driven treatment personalization is leveraging LLMs. In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating client networks from 77 therapy transcripts to support case conceptualization and treatment planning. We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts. Advantages of our approach include bottom-up case conceptualization from client utterances in therapy sessions and identification of latent themes. Networks generated from our pipeline may be used in clinical settings and supervision and training. Future research should examine whether these networks improve treatment outcomes relative to other methods of treatment personalization, including statistically estimated networks."}

Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs, while requiring significantly lower computation and memory."}

To this end, we develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical simulator with personality-driven patients and diverse student cohorts, enabling controlled testing of complex pedagogical processes and scalable generation of teaching data. Based on ClinEdu, we construct ClinTeach, a large Socratic teaching dialogue dataset that captures the complexities of group instruction. We then train MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education. MedTutor-R1 is first instruction-tuned on our ClinTeach dataset and then optimized with reinforcement learning, using rewards derived from a three-axis rubric, covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, to refine its adaptive Socratic strategies. For authentic in-situ assessment, we use simulation-based interactive evaluation that redeploys the tutor back into ClinEdu.

Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge."}

We propose a noise-aware evaluation including IDF-weighted keyword overlap as graded relevance, binarization via two thresholds (0.20 balanced, 0.28 strict), significance via paired bootstrap, and an nDCG diagnosis supported with qualitative analysis. Despite modest absolute nDCG (expected under noisy labels), the general OpenAI embedder decisively outperforms the domain pre-trained BERT in both settings at @10/@20/@100 across both thresholds; differences are statistically significant. Diagnostics attribute low absolutes to label drift and strong ideals rather than lack of utility.

These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities."}

This fused metric is demonstrated to correlate more strongly with human judgements across all tested domains for faithfulness. Improving the ability to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs, allows for greater confidence to be placed within models, allowing for their implementation in a greater diversity of scenarios.

This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99.

However, designing more compact and efficient deformation schemes together with rate-distortion-optimized compression strategies for dynamic 3DGS representations remains an underexplored area. Prior methods either rely on space-time 4DGS with overspecified, short-lived Gaussian primitives or on canonical 3DGS with deformation that lacks explicit temporal control. To address this, we present TED-4DGS, a temporally activated and embedding-based deformation scheme for rate-distortion-optimized 4DGS compression that unifies the strengths of both families. TED-4DGS is built on a sparse anchor-based 3DGS representation. Each canonical anchor is assigned learnable temporal-activation parameters to specify its appearance and disappearance transitions over time, while a lightweight per-anchor temporal embedding queries a shared deformation bank to produce anchor-specific deformation. For rate-distortion compression, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR)-based hyperprior to model anchor attribute distributions, along with a channel-wise autoregressive model to capture intra-anchor correlations. With these novel elements, our scheme achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several real-world datasets.

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability.

We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices.

Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead."}

Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in image understanding, their potential to enhance 3D object detection through intelligent data mining has not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects from driving scenes, thereby improving 3D object detection performance. Our approach synthesizes complementary techniques such as object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection into a cohesive, explainable pipeline that systematically identifies rare but critical objects in driving scenes. By combining Isolation Forest and t-SNE-based outlier detection methods with concept-based filtering, the framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects. A key strength of this approach lies in its ability to extract and annotate targeted rare object concepts such as construction vehicles, motorcycles, and barriers. This substantially reduces the annotation burden and focuses only on the most valuable training samples. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that this concept-guided data mining strategy enhances the performance of 3D object detection models while utilizing only a fraction of the training data, with particularly notable improvements for challenging object categories such as trailers and bicycles compared with the same amount of random data. This finding has substantial implications for the efficient curation of datasets in safety-critical autonomous systems."}

So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence."}

With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities. Subgroup analyses across demographic and acquisition-time strata further confirmed model stability.

To relieve the problem, we rethink the temporal manifold inherent in natural videos and observe a temporal consistency prior in dynamic scenes from the local temporal frequency perspective. Building upon the specific prior and no paired-data condition, we propose an implicit representation manner for enhanced video signals, which is conducted in the wavelet-based temporal consistency field, WaterWave. Specifically, under the constraints of the prior, we progressively filter and attenuate the inconsistent components while preserving motion details and scenes, achieving a natural-flowing video. Furthermore, to represent temporal frequency bands more accurately, an underwater flow correction module is designed to rectify estimated flows considering the transmission in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterWave significantly enhances the quality of videos generated using single-image underwater enhancements. Additionally, our method demonstrates high potential in downstream underwater tracking tasks, such as UOSTrack and MAT, outperforming the original video by a large margin, i.e., 19.7% and 9.7% on precise respectively."}

We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset. These results highlight summarization as both an opportunity for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation and a methodological choice with important implications for the reliability of automatic judgments."}

In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."}

Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions. We integrate ERC into both DAPO and GPPO reinforcement learning algorithms. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that ERC consistently improves performance."}

Under mild regularity assumptions (compactness, ergodicity, bounded Jacobian), $P$ is compact with discrete spectrum. Within this setting, we prove the Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT): the leading eigenfunctions of $P$ induce finitely many spectral basins of invariant meaning, each definable in an o-minimal structure over $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus spectral lumpability and logical tameness coincide. This explains how discrete symbolic semantics can emerge from continuous computation: the continuous activation manifold collapses into a finite, logically interpretable ontology.

Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies."}

Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS.

This study fills that gap by quantifying the number of industry-funded papers at 10 top AI conferences (e.g., ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, ACL) and their citation influence. We analyze about 49.8K papers, about 1.8M citations from AI papers to other papers, and about 2.3M citations from other papers to AI papers from 1998-2022 in Scopus. Through seven research questions, we examine the volume and evolution of industry funding in AI research, the citation impact of funded papers, the diversity and temporal range of their citations, and the subfields in which industry predominantly acts. Our findings reveal that industry presence has grown markedly since 2015, from less than 2 percent to more than 11 percent in 2020.

Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG.

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens."}

Most often, LLMs are designed as \"general purpose\" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of \"culturally-informed\" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge. Our work provides a critical foundation for research and development aimed at cultural alignment of AI technologies in practice."}

DepSeg first estimates a relative depth map with a pretrained monocular depth estimation network and proposes depth-guided point prompts, which SAM2 converts into class-agnostic masks. Each mask is then described by a pooled pretrained visual feature and classified via template matching against a template bank built from annotated frames. On the CholecSeg8k dataset, DepSeg improves over a direct SAM2 auto segmentation baseline (35.9% vs. 14.7% mIoU) and maintains competitive performance even when using only 10--20% of the object templates. These results show that depth-guided prompting and template-based classification offer an annotation-efficient segmentation approach."}

The parts of a scene that are visible at any one time are governed by the occlusion of overlapping objects. In this work we consider \"dead leaves\" models, which replicate these occlusions when generating images by layering objects on top of each other. A dead leaves model is a generative model comprised of distributions for object position, shape, color and texture. An image is generated from a dead leaves model by sampling objects (\"leaves\") from these distributions until a stopping criterion is reached, usually when the image is fully covered or until a given number of leaves was sampled. Here, we describe a theoretical approach, based on previous work, to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for the partition of a given set of pixels based on independent dead leaves model distributions. Extending previous work, we provide step-by-step explanations for the computation of the posterior probability as well as describe factors that determine the feasibility of practically applying this computation. The dead leaves image model and the associated ideal observer can be applied to study segmentation decisions in a limited number of pixels, providing a principled upper-bound on performance, to which humans and vision algorithms could be compared."}

We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. This work demonstrates that engineered natural language representations can be more effective than raw source code for scalable bug localization, providing an interpretable repository -> directory -> file search path, which is vital for building trust in enterprise AI tools by providing essential transparency."}

Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions. Our results demonstrate that co-training on this diverse data improves performance by 18 percent over existing generative augmentation methods.

A Cognitive Demand Sensor built on Harsanyi interactions estimates instantaneous vision-text synergy and identifies moments when visual grounding is necessary.

Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility.

To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge."}

To address these challenges, we propose ProPhy, a Progressive Physical Alignment Framework that enables explicit physics-aware conditioning and anisotropic generation. ProPhy employs a two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts (MoPE) mechanism for discriminative physical prior extraction, where Semantic Experts infer semantic-level physical principles from textual descriptions, and Refinement Experts capture token-level physical dynamics. This mechanism allows the model to learn fine-grained, physics-aware video representations that better reflect underlying physical laws. Furthermore, we introduce a physical alignment strategy that transfers the physical reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the Refinement Experts, facilitating a more accurate representation of dynamic physical phenomena. Extensive experiments on physics-aware video generation benchmarks demonstrate that ProPhy produces more realistic, dynamic, and physically coherent results than existing state-of-the-art methods."}

This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation.

We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control.

To simplify the cloth dynamics, existing methods mostly rely on linear blend skinning to obtain low-frequency posed garment shape and only regress high-frequency wrinkles. However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles. To tackle this issue, we propose a skinning-free approach by independently estimating posed (i) vertex position for low-frequency posed garment shape, and (ii) vertex normal for high-frequency local wrinkle details. In this way, each frequency modality can be effectively decoupled and directly supervised by the geometry of the deformed garment. To further improve the visual quality of animation, we propose to encode both vertex attributes as rendered texture images, so that 3D garment deformation can be equivalently achieved via 2D image transfer. This enables us to leverage powerful pretrained image models to recover fine-grained visual details in wrinkles, while maintaining superior scalability for garments of diverse topologies without relying on manual UV partition. Finally, we propose a multimodal fusion to incorporate constraints from both frequency modalities and robustly recover deformed 3D garments from transferred images.

While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI."}

Our method employs multi-token prediction (MTP) to reduce the number of autoregressive iterations and significantly accelerate inference. While MTP improves speed, unreliable token predictions can significantly reduce accuracy.

No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD.

NormalView embeds local geometric information into two-dimensional projections, in the form of normal vector estimates, and uses the projections as inputs to an image classification network, YOLOv11. In addition, we inspected the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance.

One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods. Our evaluation spans classic sequence-based embeddings (CBOW, GloVe), transformers (BERT, SimCSE), and a range of structure-aware algorithms, including Graph Kernels, Graph Edit Distance, Graph2Vec, and various Graph Neural Networks.

This setting is inherently challenging: source and target domains exhibit substantial distribution shifts, label spaces are disjoint, and support images are scarce--making standard episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time. To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes.

The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency.

We are the first to successfully apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for this complex, cross-domain translation task. Our UOT-based framework provides robustness to outliers in the target sRGB data, allowing it to discount atypical samples that would be prohibitively costly to map.

To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we retrained existing state-of-the-art ISP architectures using our paired and unpaired setups. Our experiments show that while our framework, when trained in paired mode, exceeds the performance of the original paired methods across all metrics, our unpaired mode concurrently achieves quantitative and qualitative performance that rivals, and in some cases surpasses, the original paired-trained counterparts.

Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\\eg, focal length and aperture value).

We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations."}

We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity.

Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise.

We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens.

We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset. These results highlight summarization as both an opportunity for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation and a methodological choice with important implications for the reliability of automatic judgments."}

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible."}

In this paper, we propose OWL for unsupervised 3D object detection by occupancy guided warm-up and large-model priors reasoning. OWL first employs an Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) strategy to initialize the backbone weight with spatial perception capabilities, mitigating the interference of incorrect pseudo-labels on network convergence.

In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."}

In this work, we introduce USV (Unified Sparsification for Video diffusion models), an end-to-end trainable framework that overcomes this limitation by jointly orchestrating sparsification across both the model's internal computation and its sampling process. USV learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy that prunes redundant attention connections, adaptively merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps, treating them not as independent tricks but as coordinated actions within a single optimization objective. This multi-dimensional co-design enables strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies. Extensive experiments on large-scale video generation benchmarks demonstrate that USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in the denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration, while maintaining high visual fidelity.

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models."}

The extensive evaluation shows that our method yields performance on par with, or even better than, complex state-of-the-art methods on all datasets.

The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results."}

While these models promise precise and personalized control, they also introduce new safety risks when model outputs are delivered directly to neural tissue. We propose a systematic, quantitative approach to detect and characterize unsafe stimulation patterns in ML-driven neurostimulation systems. Approach: We adapt an automated software testing technique known as coverage-guided fuzzing to the domain of neural stimulation. Here, fuzzing performs stress testing by perturbing model inputs and tracking whether resulting stimulation violates biophysical limits on charge density, instantaneous current, or electrode co-activation. The framework treats encoders as black boxes and steers exploration with coverage metrics that quantify how broadly test cases span the space of possible outputs and violation types. Main results: Applied to deep stimulus encoders for the retina and cortex, the method systematically reveals diverse stimulation regimes that exceed established safety limits. Two violation-output coverage metrics identify the highest number and diversity of unsafe outputs, enabling interpretable comparisons across architectures and training strategies. Significance: Violation-focused fuzzing reframes safety assessment as an empirical, reproducible process. By transforming safety from a training heuristic into a measurable property of the deployed model, it establishes a foundation for evidence-based benchmarking, regulatory readiness, and ethical assurance in next-generation neural interfaces."}

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens."}

Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions."}

However, most CTVG methods assume that personalized concepts remain static and do not expand incrementally over time. Additionally, they struggle with forgetting and concept neglect when continuously learning new concepts, including subjects and motions. To resolve the above challenges, we develop a novel Continual Customized Video Diffusion (CCVD) model, which can continuously learn new concepts to generate videos across various text-to-video generation tasks by tackling forgetting and concept neglect. To address catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a concept-specific attribute retention module and a task-aware concept aggregation strategy. They can capture the unique characteristics and identities of old concepts during training, while combining all subject and motion adapters of old concepts based on their relevance during testing. Besides, to tackle concept neglect, we develop a controllable conditional synthesis to enhance regional features and align video contexts with user conditions, by incorporating layer-specific region attention-guided noise estimation. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that our CCVD outperforms existing CTVG models. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/CCVD."}

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa.

Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains.

Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions.

This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99.

We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus.

However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet."}

The findings show broad recognition of AI importance but limited evidence of consistent engagement, practical training, or equitable access to resources.

While editing in the RAW domain provides greater accuracy and flexibility, most edits are performed on the camera's display-referred output (e.g., 8-bit sRGB JPEG) since RAW images are rarely stored. Existing RAW reconstruction methods can recover RAW data from sRGB images, but these approaches are typically optimized for pixel-wise RAW reconstruction fidelity and tend to degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations. We introduce a plug-and-play, edit-aware loss function that can be integrated into any existing RAW reconstruction framework to make the recovered RAWs more robust to different rendering styles and edits. Our loss formulation incorporates a modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines with tunable parameters. During training, parameters for each ISP module are randomly sampled from carefully designed distributions that model practical variations in real camera processing. The loss is then computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this differentiable ISP. Incorporating our loss improves sRGB reconstruction quality by up to 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. Moreover, when applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, our approach enables fine-tuning for target edits, yielding further gains. Since photographic editing is the primary motivation for RAW reconstruction in consumer imaging, our simple yet effective loss function provides a general mechanism for enhancing edit fidelity and rendering flexibility across existing methods."}

In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data."}

Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity.

Recent works address these challenges by constructing a clustering prototype bank and then refining masks in a separate stage; however, such two-stage pipelines are costly, sensitive to hyperparameters, and decouple prototype discovery from segmentation learning, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a cluster-free, one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization to enhance morphological intra-class heterogeneity coverage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on BCSS-WSSS, outperforming prior methods in mIoU and mDice. Qualitative segmentation maps show sharper boundaries and fewer mislabels, and activation heatmaps further reveal that, compared with clustering-based prototypes, our learnable prototypes cover more diverse and complementary regions within each class, providing consistent qualitative evidence for their effectiveness."}

In particular, WAFL with Vision Transformer (WAFL-ViT) has been tested on image recognition tasks with the UTokyo Building Recognition Dataset (UTBR).

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection."}

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications."}

Its success is largely attributed to deep learning, which leverages large datasets and effective loss functions to learn discriminative features.

Privacy regulations have also led to the degradation of several datasets, raising legal, ethical, and privacy concerns. Synthetic facial data generation has been proposed as a promising solution. It mitigates privacy issues, enables experimentation with controlled facial attributes, alleviates demographic bias, and provides supplementary data to improve models trained on real data. This study compares the effectiveness of synthetic facial datasets generated using different techniques in facial recognition tasks. We evaluate accuracy, rank-1, rank-5, and the true positive rate at a false positive rate of 0.01% on eight leading datasets, offering a comparative analysis not extensively explored in the literature.

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS."}

Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance.

In response, recent work proposed a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) defense using data augmentation to achieve a \\enquote{deep} safety alignment, allowing the model to generate natural language refusals immediately following harmful prefills. Unfortunately, we show in this work that the \"deep\" safety alignment produced by such an approach is in fact not very deep. A generalization of the prefilling attack, which we refer to as the Rank-Assisted Prefilling (RAP) attack, can effectively extract harmful content from models fine-tuned with the data augmentation defense by selecting low-probability \"harmful\" tokens from the top 20 predicted next tokens at each step (thus ignoring high-probability \"refusal\" tokens). We argue that this vulnerability is enabled due to the \"gaming\" of the SFT objective when the target distribution entropies are low, where low fine-tuning loss is achieved by shifting large probability mass to a small number of refusal tokens while neglecting the high ranks of harmful tokens. We then propose a new perspective on achieving deep safety alignment by matching the token ranks of the target distribution, rather than their probabilities. This perspective yields a surprisingly simple fix to the data augmentation defense based on regularizing the attention placed on harmful prefill tokens, an approach we call PRefill attEntion STOpping (PRESTO). Adding PRESTO yields up to a 4.7x improvement in the mean StrongREJECT score under RAP attacks across three popular open-source LLMs, with low impact to model utility."}

Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications."}

This study examines how users make sense of AI-generated videos on OpenAI's Sora by conducting a qualitative content analysis of user comments. Through a thematic analysis, we identified four dynamics that characterize how users negotiate authenticity, authorship, and platform governance on Sora. First, users acted as critical evaluators of realism, assessing micro-details such as lighting, shadows, fluid motion, and physics to judge whether AI-generated scenes could plausibly exist. Second, users increasingly shifted from passive viewers to active creators, expressing curiosity about prompts, techniques, and creative processes. Text prompts were perceived as intellectual property, generating concerns about plagiarism and remixing norms. Third, users reported blurred boundaries between real and synthetic media, worried about misinformation, and even questioned the authenticity of other commenters, suspecting bot-generated engagement. Fourth, users contested platform governance: some perceived moderation as inconsistent or opaque, while others shared tactics for evading prompt censorship through misspellings, alternative phrasing, emojis, or other languages. Despite this, many users also enforced ethical norms by discouraging the misuse of real people's images or disrespectful content. Together, these patterns highlighted how AI-mediated platforms complicate notions of reality, creativity, and rule-making in emerging digital ecosystems.

Across reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, OlympiadBench, MinervaMath, GSM8K, MMLU), RoBoN consistently outperforms standard best-of-$n$ applied to each individual model for larger $n$, with gains of up to 3.4\\% in absolute accuracy, and also improves over a uniform multi-model portfolio baseline. Our results indicate that diversity across models can be exploited at inference to improve best-of-$n$ performance over any constituent model alone, providing a simple, training-free path to test-time scaling with multiple LLMs."}

A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet currently forces a critical trade-off: methods either sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features or fail to model dynamic problems due to static, non-interleaved structures. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning."}

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity."}

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map. We then present an algorithm (MoJet) for empirical jet estimation and mirage diagnostics, and illustrate the framework using linear and deep regression as well as pipeline classification."}

This limitation arises from training VLMs on static internet-scale visual-language data that contain no causal interactions or action-conditioned changes. Consequently, it remains challenging to leverage VLMs for fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks that require physical understanding, reasoning, and corresponding action planning. To overcome this, we present SIMPACT, a test-time, SIMulation-enabled ACTion Planning framework that equips VLMs with physical reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling, without requiring any additional training. From a single RGB-D observation, SIMPACT efficiently constructs physics simulations, enabling the VLM to propose informed actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine its reasoning. By integrating language reasoning with physics prediction, our simulation-enabled VLM can understand contact dynamics and action outcomes in a physically grounded way. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five challenging, real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks that require fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models. Our results demonstrate that embedding physics understanding via efficient simulation into VLM reasoning at test time offers a promising path towards generalizable embodied intelligence.

Our findings reveal that industry presence has grown markedly since 2015, from less than 2 percent to more than 11 percent in 2020. Between 2018 and 2022, 12 percent of industry-funded papers achieved high citation rates as measured by the h5-index, compared to 4 percent of non-industry-funded papers and 2 percent of non-funded papers. Top AI conferences engage more with industry-funded research than non-funded research, as measured by our newly proposed metric, the Citation Preference Ratio (CPR). We show that industry-funded research is increasingly insular, citing predominantly other industry-funded papers while referencing fewer non-funded papers. These findings reveal new trends in AI research funding, including a shift towards more industry-funded papers and their growing citation impact, greater insularity of industry-funded work than non-funded work, and a preference of industry-funded research to cite recent work."}

Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe) has been proposed as a resource-efficient framework that integrates a lightweight base classifier with Conformal Prediction to guide LLM prompting by adaptively reducing the set of candidate classes. However, its broader applicability and efficiency benefits beyond a single domain have not yet been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks. The results show that CICLe consistently improves over its base classifier and outperforms few-shot prompting baselines when the sample size is sufficient for training the base classifier, and performs comparably in low-data regimes. In terms of efficiency, CICLe reduces the number of shots and prompt length by up to 34.45% and 25.16%, respectively, and enables the use of smaller models with competitive performance. CICLe is furthermore particularly advantageous for text classification tasks with high class imbalance. These findings highlight CICLe as a practical and scalable approach for efficient text classification, combining the robustness of traditional classifiers with the adaptability of LLMs, and achieving substantial gains in data and computational efficiency."}

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens."}

These findings advance the mechanistic interpretability of domain-specific protein language models and suggest that, while TopK SAEs are sufficient for mapping latent features to concepts, Ordered SAEs are preferable when precise generative steering is required."}

A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans."}

Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations.

Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models."}

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines. We further demonstrate the versatility of Neural Coherence as a powerful principle by showing its effectiveness in training data selection."}

We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection."}

Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties.

These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data.

Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications."}

However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $α$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis."}

Ren", "Michael Equi", "Sergey Levine"], "title": "Training-Time Action Conditioning for Efficient Real-Time Chunking", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Real-time chunking (RTC) enables vision-language-action models (VLAs) to generate smooth, reactive robot trajectories by asynchronously predicting action chunks and conditioning on previously committed actions via inference-time inpainting. However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control."}

Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools."}
