Now that 21st\ncentury cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories\nto artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this\nhistory. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from\nexperiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which\ntakes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is\npragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally\nfulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,\ntranscends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or\nchains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about\nthe value of intuition and reflection."}

In\nhealthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired\ndigital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis.\nHowever, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents\nsignificant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive\nannotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g.,\nregions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in\ntemporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing\na holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should\nincorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making\nthis task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified\nIncremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address\ntemporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining\nout-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The\nkey innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD\ncontinual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships\nbetween existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental\nuniversal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS\nmethod effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation,\nenabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units,\nand cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This\ncapability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust\napproach for real-world digital pathology applications."}

Hence, in this work, we\nprovide the formal basis for synchronized model and event abstraction, i.e., we\nprove that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model\nfrom an abstracted event log yields an equivalent process model. We prove the\nfeasibility of our approach based on behavioral profile abstraction as\nnon-order preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique."}

To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging\ninstrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based\nframework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI.

In Stage-I,\nwe fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely\norchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In\nStage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500\nrigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs\nwith our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \\textit{MedE$^2$} in\nimproving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models.

Firstly, this paper identifies\napproach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four\ndistinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,\nand lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering\nprocess indicate the common semantics of the step components within the\napproach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within\nthe class.

Specifically, we exploit both global- and\npatch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained\nCLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into\nnon-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a\nprojection layer.

A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and\ntext tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.\nBased on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic\nand label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR.

While recent\nefforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often\nknowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric,\ncomplex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning\ncomplexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained\noperations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The\nquestions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling\nobserved visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and\npredicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have\nto precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step\nreasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using\nVideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal\nLLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning,\ne.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced\nGemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy.

This is an advance not previously demonstrated in the wound segmentation\nliterature.\n  Results: Evaluated on three real-world test sets spanning foot, sacral, and\ntrochanter wounds, our YOLO plus FUSegNet pipeline improved mean IoU by 23\npercentage points over vanilla FUSegNet and increased end-to-end DESIGN-R size\nestimation accuracy from 71 percent to 94 percent (see Table 3 for details).\n  Conclusion: Our pipeline generalizes effectively across body sites without\ntask-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating that minimal supervision, with 500\nannotated ROIs, is sufficient for scalable, annotation-light wound\nsegmentation. This capability paves the way for real-world DESIGN-R automation,\nreducing reliance on pixel-wise labeling, streamlining documentation workflows,\nand supporting objective and consistent wound scoring in clinical practice. We\nwill publicly release the trained detector weights and configuration to promote\nreproducibility and facilitate downstream deployment."}

Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have\nmade some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large\namounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm\ncalled Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves\nhigher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data\nsize needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a\nHierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the\ntime-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via\nquantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search\nprocess. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW\nmethod, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and\nsignificantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as\nrevealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis."}

Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the\nimportance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve\ncritical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:\nrather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute\nparameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By\nminimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our\napproach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby\nenhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,\nwhich applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight\nmatrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated\non LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4\nsemi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and\nzero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4\nsemi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the\ndense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points.

Inspired by human visual\ndecision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces,\nguiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When\nfine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables\nthe model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds.\nAcross a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK\nfor spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and\nVisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both\nsupervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit\ngrounding mechanisms.

Existing\napproaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:\nToken-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage\nsignals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training\nan accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,\nGRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,\nleading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we\npropose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages\nsegment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a\nbetter balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level\nmethods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,\nenabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a\ncritic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible\nsegment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy\noptimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask\nstrategy.

In this work, we address this gap\nby utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution\nover token sequences that captures the information gained during policy\nupdates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential\ninformation required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the\nlog-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the\ntarget policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected\nresponses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode\ndifferential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption\nregarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in\npreference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the\nentropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential\ninformation reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential\ninformation induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood\ndisplacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic\nexperiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our\nresults suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial\nfor general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential\ninformation benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work\npresents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of\npreference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of\ndifferential information."}

Recent works address both issues by\n(i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework,\nand (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a\nmemory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and\nincreased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of\npost-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the\nneed for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied\nappropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for\nbuffer-based OOD detection.

Existing approaches\nprimarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is\nexpensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating\nmultiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.\nAlthough effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly\nscoring, limiting its practical application.

For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the\nclassifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a \"garbage\" class, initially\npopulated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs.

However, traditional automated\ntheorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that\npoorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language\nknowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a\ncomprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to\nenhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale\nbenchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems\nand proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for\ncorrectness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically\nconstructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement\nlearning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,\nleveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical\ninference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process\nevaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning\nsteps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly\nimproves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and\nsupervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and\nreasoning quality.

In this\npaper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve\nrebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of\ndiverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic\nsubstitutions to spatially-dependent cues (\"head\" over \"heels\"). We analyze how\ndifferent VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some\nsurprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle\nsignificantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and\nunderstanding visual metaphors."}

Despite\nits empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio\nreward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap\nby utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution\nover token sequences that captures the information gained during policy\nupdates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential\ninformation required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the\nlog-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the\ntarget policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected\nresponses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode\ndifferential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption\nregarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in\npreference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the\nentropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential\ninformation reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential\ninformation induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood\ndisplacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic\nexperiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our\nresults suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial\nfor general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential\ninformation benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work\npresents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of\npreference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of\ndifferential information."}

To enable research in this\ndirection, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative\nquestions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations.
