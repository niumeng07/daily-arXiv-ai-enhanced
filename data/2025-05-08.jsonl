Inspired by human reasoning, we\nintroduce a method of first-order relational probabilistic inference that\nsatisfies both criteria, and can handle hybrid (discrete and continuous)\nvariables. Specifically, we extend sum-of-squares logic of expectation to\nrelational settings, demonstrating that lifted reasoning in the bounded-degree\nfragment for knowledge bases of bounded quantifier rank can be performed in\npolynomial time, even with an a priori unknown and/or countably infinite set of\nobjects. Crucially, our notion of tractability is framed in proof-theoretic\nterms, which extends beyond the syntactic properties of the language or\nqueries. We are able to derive the tightest bounds provable by proofs of a\ngiven degree and size and establish completeness in our sum-of-squares\nrefutations for fixed degrees."}

Second, we compare the original\nalgorithm by Korf & Chickering with the variant proposed by Cohen-Solal, which\ndiffers in its backpropagation strategy: instead of stopping when a stable\nvalue is encountered, it updates values up to the root. This change slightly\nimproves performance when value ties or transposition tables are involved.\nThird, we assess replacing the exact terminal evaluation function with the\nlearned heuristic function. While beneficial when exact evaluations are costly,\nthis modification reduces performance in inexpensive settings. Finally, we\nexamine the impact of the completion technique that prioritizes resolved\nwinning states and avoids resolved losing states. This technique also improves\nperformance. Overall, our findings highlight how targeted modifications can\nenhance the efficiency of Unbounded Best-First Minimax."}

We use ``test sample complexity'' to\nquantify the number of test points needed for a certifiable evaluation and\nderive tight bounds on test sample complexity. Based on the developed theory,\nwe develop a partition-based algorithm, named Cer-Eval, that adaptively selects\ntest points to minimize the cost of LLM evaluation.

While\nthe majority of the work focuses on classifying stress states and stress\ncategories, this study introduce a new task aimed at estimating more specific\nstressors (like exam, writing paper, etc.) through users' posts on social\nmedia. Unfortunately, the diversity of stressors with many different classes\nbut a few examples per class, combined with the consistent arising of new\nstressors over time, hinders the machine understanding of stressors. To this\nend, we cast the stressor estimation problem within a practical scenario\nfew-shot learning setting, and propose a novel meta-learning based stressor\nestimation framework that is enhanced by a meta-knowledge inheritance\nmechanism. This model can not only learn generic stressor context through\nmeta-learning, but also has a good generalization ability to estimate new\nstressors with little labeled data. A fundamental breakthrough in our approach\nlies in the inclusion of the meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism, which equips\nour model with the ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting to\nnew stressors. The experimental results show that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared with the baselines.

While existing methods\nleverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling\ndepth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth\nprediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes\nare intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which\nultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which\nleverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and\nconditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight\nAttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features.\nNext, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features\nfrom one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to\naggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later\nattribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes\nwithout forgetting the features of earlier ones.

Therefore, it remains unclear\nhow to effectively extend reasoning capabilities beyond text input and general\ndomains. This paper explores a fundamental research question: Is reasoning\ngeneralizable across modalities and domains? Our findings support an\naffirmative answer: General-domain text-based post-training can enable such\nstrong generalizable reasoning. Leveraging this finding, we introduce\nX-Reasoner, a vision-language model post-trained solely on general-domain text\nfor generalizable reasoning, using a two-stage approach: an initial supervised\nfine-tuning phase with distilled long chain-of-thoughts, followed by\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Experiments show that\nX-Reasoner successfully transfers reasoning capabilities to both multimodal and\nout-of-domain settings, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models trained\nwith in-domain and multimodal data across various general and medical\nbenchmarks (Figure 1). Additionally, we find that X-Reasoner's performance in\nspecialized domains can be further enhanced through continued training on\ndomain-specific text-only data.

This paper explores\nwhether Large Language Models (LLMs) can offer an alternative approach for GPU\nperformance prediction without relying on hardware. We frame the problem as a\nroofline classification task: given the source code of a GPU kernel and the\nhardware specifications of a target GPU, can an LLM predict whether the GPU\nkernel is compute-bound or bandwidth-bound?\n  For this study, we build a balanced dataset of 340 GPU kernels, obtained from\nHeCBench benchmark and written in CUDA and OpenMP, along with their\nground-truth labels obtained via empirical GPU profiling. We evaluate LLMs\nacross four scenarios: (1) with access to profiling data of the kernel source,\n(2) zero-shot with source code only, (3) few-shot with code and label pairs,\nand (4) fine-tuned on a small custom dataset.\n  Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs have a strong understanding of\nthe Roofline model, achieving 100% classification accuracy when provided with\nexplicit profiling data. We also find that reasoning-capable LLMs significantly\noutperform standard LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings, achieving up to 64%\naccuracy on GPU source codes, without profiling information. Lastly, we find\nthat LLM fine-tuning will require much more data than what we currently have\navailable.\n  This work is among the first to use LLMs for source-level roofline\nperformance prediction via classification, and illustrates their potential to\nguide optimization efforts when runtime profiling is infeasible.
