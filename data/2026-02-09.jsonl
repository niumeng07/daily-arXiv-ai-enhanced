However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines."}

Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results.

However, most agent memory systems only emphasize semantic recall and treat experience as structures such as key-value, vector, or graph, which makes them struggle to represent and retrieve coherent events. To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory. Moreover, CAST complements this episodic memory with a graph-based semantic memory, which yields a robust dual memory design. Experiments demonstrate that CAST has averagely improved 8.11% F1 and 10.21% J(LLM-as-a-Judge) than baselines on various datasets, especially on open and time-sensitive conversational questions."}

Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric).

Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \\sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs."}

Project Page: https://humansensinglab.github.io/super-head/", "summary": "Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D talking heads is crucial for immersive applications, yet often hindered by the prevalence of low-quality image or video sources, which yield poor 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality."}

PersonaPlex is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of paired prompts and user-agent conversations, generated with open-source large language models (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) models.

Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area."}

Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community."}

Using nearly 80K novelty-annotated reviews from top-tier AI conferences, we fine-tune a large language model to capture reviewer-aligned novelty evaluation behavior. For a given manuscript, the system extracts structured representations of its ideas, methods, and claims, retrieves semantically related papers, and constructs a similarity graph that enables fine-grained, concept-level comparison to prior work. Conditioning on this structured evidence, the model produces calibrated novelty scores and human-like explanatory assessments, reducing overestimation and improving consistency relative to existing approaches."}

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals."}

Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators. (3) Less educated annotators are more subjective, while educated ones tend to broadly agree more between themselves.

However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by \"baking in\" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for \"texture baking,\" while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality."}

Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench."}

We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice."}

Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks.

However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling.

Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration. To address these challenges, we establish a benchmark framework for disease- and parameter-agnostic, real-time-compatible unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI. The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation. With a reconstruction time of approximately 92.6 frames per second, the proposed framework establishes a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in the female pelvis and supports future integration into real-time MRI.

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.\n  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems."}

By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data.

We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks.

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reasoning over textual transcriptions for emotion recognition, they typically neglect fine-grained prosodic information, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure."}

Combining BTs with RL has the potential for mutual benefit: a BT design encodes structured domain knowledge that can simplify RL training, while RL enables automatic learning of the controllers within BTs.

Specifically, for GPT-OSS-120B, it improves Acc@1 from 67.2 to 76.3 and AUC from 71.4 to 79.6, with similarly large AUC gains on GPT-OSS-20B (69.0 to 79.2). Furthermore, compared to LLM-Judges, it also exhibits a larger solver-evaluator gap, maintaining a stronger correct-wrong separation even on instances where the underlying solver often fails to solve."}

Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent."}

To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable."}

Disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structure routinely violate standard Universal Dependencies (UD) assumptions, causing parsers and large language models (LLMs) to fail despite strong performance on written data. These failures are compounded by rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine structural errors with acceptable variation. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to spoken CSW parsing. We introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken CSW phenomena and SpokeBench, an expert-annotated gold benchmark designed to test spoken-language structure beyond standard UD assumptions. We further propose FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, which reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken CSW by penalizing linguistically plausible analyses as errors. We then propose DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis. Experiments show that DECAP produces more robust and interpretable parses without retraining and achieves up to 52.6% improvements over existing parsing techniques. FLEX-UD evaluations further reveal qualitative improvements that are masked by standard metrics."}

While 3D hand reconstruction from in-the-wild videos has seen significant progress, reconstructing the involved objects remains challenging due to severe occlusions and the complex, coupled motion of the camera, hands, and object. In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion. Furthermore, to support the training of our model, we contribute the first large-scale, high-fidelity synthetic dataset of hand-object interactions with comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForeHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in object reconstruction, significantly outperforming previous methods with around a 100x speedup.

We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3. Furthermore, the post-trained LLMs exhibit strong generalization and robustness under real-world conditions such as distribution shifts and noisy data.

This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent.

However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines.

We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property.

SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.\n  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability."}

Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability.

Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers."}

To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space.

We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy.

We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL.

Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}

However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities.

Our analysis reveals that SSMs outperform Transformers at capturing code syntax and semantics in pretraining but forgets certain syntactic and semantic relations during fine-tuning on task, especially when the task emphasizes short-range dependencies. To diagnose this, we introduce SSM-Interpret, a frequency-domain framework that exposes a spectral shift toward short-range dependencies during fine-tuning. Guided by these findings, we propose architectural modifications that significantly improve the performance of SSM-based code model, validating that our analysis directly enables better models."}

In this work, we explore facilitating better CTTA in the long run using a re-initialization (or reset) based method. First, we observe that the long-term performance is associated with the trajectory pattern in label flip. Based on this observed correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization (ABR), towards preserving the model's long-term performance. In particular, ABR performs weight re-initialization using adaptive intervals. The adaptive interval is determined based on the change in label flip. The proposed method is validated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving superior performance."}

Humor generation, especially in multi-modal scenarios, is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), which is typically as funny caption generation for images, requiring visual understanding, humor reasoning, creative imagination, and so on. Existing LLM-based approaches rely on reasoning chains or self-improvement, which suffer from limited creativity and interpretability. To address these bottlenecks, we develop a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism based on a fundamental humor theory, GTVH. To produce funny and script-opposite captions, we introduce a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework augmented with humor retrieval (HOMER). The framework consists of three LLM-based roles: (1) conflicting-script extractor that grounds humor in key script oppositions, forming the basis of caption generation; (2) retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that identifies key humor targets and expands the creative space of them through diverse associations structured as imagination trees; and (3) caption generator that produces funny and diverse captions conditioned on the obtained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two New Yorker Cartoon benchmarking datasets show that HOMER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and powerful LLM reasoning strategies on multi-modal humor captioning."}

Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting \"safe\" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that \"confirmation bias\" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought."}

This computational mismatch not only incurs resource waste but also induces semantic hallucination, where deep networks forcefully interpret physical anomalies as high-confidence semantic features.To address this, we propose the Cascaded Early Rejection (CER) framework, which realizes hierarchical filtering for anomaly detection via a coarse-to-fine logic.CER comprises two core modules: 1)Structural Energy Sieve (SES), which establishes a non-parametric barrier at the network entry using the Laplacian operator to efficiently intercept physical signal anomalies; and 2) the Semantically-aware Hyperspherical Energy (SHE) detector, which decouples feature magnitude from direction in intermediate layers to identify fine-grained semantic deviations. Experimental results demonstrate that CER not only reduces computational overhead by 32% but also achieves a significant performance leap on the CIFAR-100 benchmark:the average FPR95 drastically decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, and AUROC improves to 93.97%. Crucially, in real-world scenarios simulating sensor failures, CER exhibits performance far exceeding state-of-the-art methods.

Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods.

Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates.

Extensive experiments on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance while significantly improving query efficiency. These results underscore the importance of historical vulnerability signals in reinforcement learning-driven jailbreak strategies and offer a principled pathway for advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards."}

POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency."}

However, its performance is severely dependent on the quality of manual prompts. In addition, the RGB images that instance segmentation methods normally use inherently lack depth information. As a result, the ability of these methods to perceive spatial structures and delineate object boundaries is hindered. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets. These promising results should be due to the guidance of the self-prompts and the compensation for the spatial information loss by the coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion operation."}

To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination.

RelayGen identifies model-specific switch cues that signal transitions to lower-difficulty segments and dynamically delegates their continuation to a smaller model, while preserving high-difficulty reasoning on the large model. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, RelayGen substantially reduces inference latency while preserving most of the accuracy of large models. When combined with speculative decoding, RelayGen achieves up to 2.2$\\times$ end-to-end speedup with less than 2\\% accuracy degradation, without requiring additional training or learned routing components."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.\n  Resources:\n  https://github.com/VectorInstitute/unified-xai-evaluation-framework https://vectorinstitute.github.io/unified-xai-evaluation-framework"}

However, TIR focuses primarily on the person's silhouette, neglecting critical texture details essential for detection. While the near-infrared (NIR) captures texture under low-light conditions, which effectively alleviates performance issues of RGB and detail loss in TIR, thereby reducing missed detections. To this end, we construct a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR (TRNT) dataset, comprising 8,281 pixel-aligned image triplets, establishing a comprehensive foundation for algorithmic research. However, due to the variable nature of real-world scenarios, imaging devices may not always capture all three modalities simultaneously. This results in input data with unpredictable combinations of modal types, which challenge existing CMPD methods that fail to extract robust pedestrian information under arbitrary input combinations, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Network (AUNet) for accurately discriminating modal availability and fully utilizing the available information under uncertain inputs. Specifically, we introduce Unified Modality Validation Refinement (UMVR), which includes an uncertainty-aware router to validate modal availability and a semantic refinement to ensure the reliability of information within the modality.

As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses.

As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction.

Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models."}

In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric). We then analyze how memory is instantiated and operated under different agent topologies and highlight learning policies over memory operations. Finally, we review evaluation benchmarks and metrics for assessing memory utility, and outline various open challenges and future directions."}

However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks."}

We introduce Inference-Time Rethinking, a generative framework that enables iterative self-correction by decoupling declarative latent thought vectors from procedural generation. We factorize reasoning into a continuous latent thought vector (what to reason about) and a decoder that verbalizes the trace conditioned on this vector (how to reason). Beyond serving as a declarative buffer, latent thought vectors compress the reasoning structure into a continuous representation that abstracts away surface-level token variability, making gradient-based optimization over reasoning strategies well-posed. Our prior model maps unstructured noise to a learned manifold of valid reasoning patterns, and at test time we employ a Gibbs-style procedure that alternates between generating a candidate trace and optimizing the latent vector to better explain that trace, effectively navigating the latent manifold to refine the reasoning strategy. Training a 0.2B-parameter model from scratch on GSM8K, our method with 30 rethinking iterations surpasses baselines with 10 to 15 times more parameters, including a 3B counterpart. This result demonstrates that effective mathematical reasoning can emerge from sophisticated inference-time computation rather than solely from massive parameter counts."}

This progress naturally raises a critical yet unexplored question: can Multimodal dLLMs serve as effective multimodal embedding models? To answer this, we present the first systematic study of converting Multimodal dLLMs into embedding models. We evaluate state-of-the-art Multimodal dLLMs and Autoregressive VLMs across three categories of embedding tasks: classification, visual question answering, and information retrieval. Our results show that Multimodal dLLM embeddings generally underperform their autoregressive VLM counterparts. The stronger diffusion-based model, LaViDa, lags by only 3.5 points on classification, 2.5 points on VQA, and 4.4 points on retrieval tasks, whereas the other diffusion-based model, MMaDA, exhibits substantially larger performance gaps, exceeding 20 points across all tasks. Further analysis reveals insufficient image-text alignment in diffusion-based models, accounting for the observed limitations in their embedding performance."}

Recent work has addressed this problem by scaling self-consistency and parallel thinking, adding generic ``thinking tokens'' and prompting models to re-read the question before answering. Unfortunately, these approaches either inject task-agnostic tokens or mandate heuristics that do not explain -- and often ignore -- the \\emph{spontaneous} repetition that many LRMs exhibit at the head of their internal chains. In contrast, we analyze and harness the model's tendency to restate the question, which we term the \\emph{Echo of Prompt (EOP)}, as a front-loaded, compute-shaping mechanism. We formalize its probabilistic cost by casting echo removal as rejection-based conditioning and defining the \\emph{Echo Likelihood Gap} $Δ\\mathcal{L}$ as a computable proxy. This provides the missing theoretical link that links early repetition to likelihood gains and downstream accuracy. However, it does not by itself specify how to exploit EOP. Consequently, we develop \\emph{Echo-Distilled SFT (ED-SFT)} to instill an ``echo-then-reason'' pattern through supervised finetuning, and \\emph{Echoic Prompting (EP)} to re-ground the model mid-trace without training. While promising, quantifying benefits beyond verbosity is non-trivial. Therefore, we conduct length and suffix-controlled likelihood analyses together with layer-wise attention studies, showing that EOP increases answer to answer-prefix attention in middle layers, consistent with an \\emph{attention refocusing} mechanism.

We introduce SemGeo-AttentionNet, a dual-stream architecture that explicitly formalizes this dichotomy through asymmetric cross-modal fusion, leveraging diffusion-based semantic priors from geometry-conditioned multi-view rendering and point cloud transformers for geometric processing. Cross-attention ensures geometric features query semantic content, enabling bottom-up distinctiveness to guide top-down retrieval.

Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content. On the RealToxicityPrompts, our method achieves strong mitigation performance compared to existing baselines, with minimal impact on inference complexity. Across multiple LLMs, our approach reduces toxicity of state-of-the-art detoxification systems by 8-20%, while maintaining comparable fluency.

This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint. A comprehensive comparative analysis against conventional single-objective compression techniques validates the HQP framework as a superior, hardware-agnostic solution for deploying ultra-low-latency AI in resource-limited edge infrastructures."}

However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's \"pure\" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation.

To address these issues, we propose FairJudge, an adaptive, debiased, and consistent LLM-as-a-Judge. Unlike prior approaches that treat the judge as a static evaluator, FairJudge models judging behavior itself as a learnable and regularized policy. From a data-centric perspective, we construct a high-information-density judging dataset that explicitly injects supervision signals aligned with evaluation behavior. Building on this dataset, we adopt a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm that progressively aligns rubric adherence, bias mitigation, and cross-mode consistency, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on multiple internal and public benchmarks show that FairJudge consistently improves agreement and F1, reduces non-semantic biases, and outperforms substantially larger instruction-tuned LLMs. All resources will be publicly released after acceptance to facilitate future research."}

To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements.

To validate this hypothesis and decide which layers to restore, we design a proxy task -- Constrained Random Character(CRC) -- with an explicit validity set and a natural diversity objective. Results on CRC reveal a clear diversity-validity trade-off across restoration ranges and identify configurations that increase diversity with minimal quality loss. Based on these findings, we propose Selective Layer Restoration (SLR), a training-free method that restores selected layers in a post-trained model to their pre-trained weights, yielding a hybrid model with the same architecture and parameter count, incurring no additional inference cost. Across three different tasks (creative writing, open-ended question answering, and multi-step reasoning) and three different model families (Llama, Qwen, and Gemma), we find SLR can consistently and substantially improve output diversity while maintaining high output quality."}

In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \\textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \\textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \\emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations.

A Strong Synthetic Engine with Diverse Simulations and Self-Evolution", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large-scale and categorical-balanced text data is essential for training effective Scene Text Recognition (STR) models, which is hard to achieve when collecting real data. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective and perfectly labeled alternative. However, its performance often lags behind, revealing a significant domain gap between real and current synthetic data. In this work, we systematically analyze mainstream rendering-based synthetic datasets and identify their key limitations: insufficient diversity in corpus, font, and layout, which restricts their realism in complex scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce UnionST, a strong data engine synthesizes text covering a union of challenging samples and better aligns with the complexity observed in the wild. We then construct UnionST-S, a large-scale synthetic dataset with improved simulations in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for effective real data annotation. Experiments show that models trained on UnionST-S achieve significant improvements over existing synthetic datasets. They even surpass real-data performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, when using SEL, the trained models achieve competitive performance by only seeing 9% of real data labels."}

This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference."}

Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly those containing diffusion-generated forgery faces."}

Using Ekman's six basic emotions (e.g., joy, disgust), we examine various prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting using gpt-3.5-turbo, and compare it to fine-tuning. Our results indicate that prompt engineering effectively steers emotions in AI-generated texts, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, especially in data-constrained settings. In this regard, Few-Shot prompting with human-written examples was the most effective among other techniques, likely due to the additional task-specific guidance.

We theoretically prove that estimators based on fuzzy functional similarity add an inductive bias and strictly dominate estimators based on functional equivalence in terms of signal-to-noise ratio.

To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter. These results establish linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings."}

We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments. Our empirical evaluation reveals substantial S-Corr even for competitive GenRMs, and higher S-Corr is associated with policy degeneration under optimization. To improve fidelity, we propose Rationale-Centric Alignment, R-Align, which augments training with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment. R-Align reduces S-Corr on RM benchmarks and yields consistent gains in actor performance across STEM, coding, instruction following, and general tasks."}

SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling.

This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances. To facilitate research, we further curate three specialized benchmarks, including simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection.

Our findings indicate that classification approaches that leverage these error taxonomies, or \"rubrics\", demonstrate strong error identification compared to baseline methods in technical domains like coding, math, and chemical engineering. These rubrics can be used to build stronger LLM-as-judge reward functions for reasoning model training via reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that these rewards have the potential to improve models' task accuracy on difficult domains over models trained by general LLMs-as-judges by +45%, and approach performance of models trained by verifiable rewards while using as little as 20% as many gold labels. Through our approach, we extend the usage of reward rubrics from assessing qualitative model behavior to assessing quantitative model correctness on tasks typically learned via RLVR rewards.

We qualitatively analyzed ten cases of active listening to distill five context-aware pacing strategies: Reflective Silence, Facilitative Silence, Empathic Silence, Holding Space, and Immediate Response. In a between-subjects study (N=50) with two conversational scenarios (relationship and career-support), the context-aware agent scored higher than static-pacing control on perceived human-likeness, smoothness, and interactivity, supporting deeper self-disclosure and higher engagement.

To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions.

We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text.

However, existing multi-condition generative frameworks often struggle to harmonize these inputs, leading to \"condition conflicts\" where stylistic attributes inadvertently compromise the geometric precision of the layout. To address this challenge, we present DreamHome-Pano, a controllable panoramic generation framework designed for high-fidelity interior synthesis. Our approach introduces a Prompt-LLM that serves as a semantic bridge, effectively translating layout constraints and style references into professional descriptive prompts to achieve precise cross-modal alignment. To safeguard architectural integrity during the generative process, we develop a Conflict-Free Control architecture that incorporates structural-aware geometric priors and a multi-condition decoupling strategy, effectively suppressing stylistic interference from eroding the spatial layout. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive panoramic interior benchmark alongside a multi-stage training pipeline, encompassing progressive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate that DreamHome-Pano achieves a superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering a robust and professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization."}

While prior work has discovered evidence for both, a mechanistic account of how these properties coexist and transform across tasks remains elusive. We propose that representational sharing lies not in the concepts themselves, but in the geometric relations between them. Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces. Together, these results provide a mechanistic lens of how language models balance the shared structure of number representation with functional flexibility. It suggests that understanding arises when task-specific transformations are applied to a shared underlying relational structure of conceptual representations."}

Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality."}

Spaceborne LiDAR missions, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide global observations of forest structure but are spatially sparse and subject to inherent uncertainties. In contrast, near-surface LiDAR platforms, such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems, offer much finer measurements of forest canopy structure, and a growing number of countries have made these datasets openly available. In this study, a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model, Depth Anything V2, was trained using approximately 16,000 km2 of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from publicly available airborne LiDAR point clouds and related products across multiple countries, together with 3 m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery. The trained model, referred to as Depth2CHM, enables the estimation of spatially continuous CHMs directly from PlanetScope RGB imagery. Independent validation was conducted at sites in China (approximately 1 km2) and the United States (approximately 116 km2). The results showed that Depth2CHM could accurately estimate canopy height, with biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for these two sites, respectively. Compared with an existing global meter-resolution CHM product, the mean absolute error is reduced by approximately 1.5 m and the RMSE by approximately 2 m.

Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants.

To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision.

Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy.

To address these challenges, we built Personagram, an interactive system powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that helps designers explore detailed census-based personas, extract product features inferred from persona attributes, and recombine them for specific customer segments. In a study with 12 professional designers, we show that Personagram facilitates more actionable ideation workflows by structuring multimodal thinking from persona attributes to product design features, achieving higher engagement with personas, perceived transparency, and satisfaction compared to a chat-based baseline.

We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a \"subwords manifest\", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity.

A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality.

While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the \"optimal\" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning."}

Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available."}

InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance."}

Recent advances in large foundation models have substantially accelerated the development of embedding models, including those based on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), and Multimodal LLMs. More recently, Large Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Multimodal dLLMs have emerged as competitive alternatives to autoregressive models, offering advantages such as bidirectional attention and parallel generation. This progress naturally raises a critical yet unexplored question: can Multimodal dLLMs serve as effective multimodal embedding models? To answer this, we present the first systematic study of converting Multimodal dLLMs into embedding models. We evaluate state-of-the-art Multimodal dLLMs and Autoregressive VLMs across three categories of embedding tasks: classification, visual question answering, and information retrieval. Our results show that Multimodal dLLM embeddings generally underperform their autoregressive VLM counterparts. The stronger diffusion-based model, LaViDa, lags by only 3.5 points on classification, 2.5 points on VQA, and 4.4 points on retrieval tasks, whereas the other diffusion-based model, MMaDA, exhibits substantially larger performance gaps, exceeding 20 points across all tasks. Further analysis reveals insufficient image-text alignment in diffusion-based models, accounting for the observed limitations in their embedding performance."}

This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding. This design enables fine-grained analysis of performance degradation under increasing environmental and task complexity; 2) A high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation, where each scene supports multiple fine-grained manipulation objectives to bridge the train-evaluation distribution gap.

Studies of the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) support their ability to parse text when predicting the next word, while representing semantic notions independently of surface form. Yet, which data statistics make these feats possible, and how much data is required, remain largely unknown. Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide a tractable testbed for studying these questions. However, prior work has focused either on the post-hoc characterization of the parsing-like algorithms used by trained networks; or on the learnability of PCFGs with fixed syntax, where parsing is unnecessary. Here, we (i) introduce a tunable class of PCFGs in which both the degree of ambiguity and the correlation structure across scales can be controlled; (ii) provide a learning mechanism -- an inference algorithm inspired by the structure of deep convolutional networks -- that links learnability and sample complexity to specific language statistics; and (iii) validate our predictions empirically across deep convolutional and transformer-based architectures. Overall, we propose a unifying framework where correlations at different scales lift local ambiguities, enabling the emergence of hierarchical representations of the data."}

Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses \"thinking with images\" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\\times$ lower token budget."}

SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling.

However, these models are computationally complex to evaluate, posing a challenge for popular RL approaches that have been successfully used with simulators to solve complex locomotion tasks but yet struggle with manipulation. This paper introduces a method that bypasses simulators entirely, training RL policies inside world models learned from robots' interactions with real environments. At its core, our approach enables policy training with large-scale diffusion models via a novel decoupled first-order gradient (FoG) method: a full-scale world model generates accurate forward trajectories, while a lightweight latent-space surrogate approximates its local dynamics for efficient gradient computation. This coupling of a local and global world model ensures high-fidelity unrolling alongside computationally tractable differentiation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the Push-T manipulation task, where it significantly outperforms PPO in sample efficiency. We further evaluate our approach through an ego-centric object manipulation task with a quadruped. Together, these results demonstrate that learning inside data-driven world models is a promising pathway for solving hard-to-model RL tasks in image space without reliance on hand-crafted physics simulators."}

Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness.

Traditionally, such locally optimized decisions are made by hand-coded algorithms tuned for a small number of benchmarks, often requiring significant effort to be retuned when the benchmark suite changes.

This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives.

As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities.

In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs."}

Our approach integrates a frequency-based augmentation strategy to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and a causal suppression loss that mitigates non-causal biases and reinforces causal surgical features. These components are combined in a unified training framework that enables the model to focus on stable causal factors underlying surgical workflows.

Traditional codecs preserve acoustic details well but lack semantic information. Recent hybrid codecs attempt to incorporate semantic information through distillation, but this often degrades reconstruction performance, making it difficult to achieve both. To address this limitation, we introduce STACodec, a unified codec that integrates semantic information from self-supervised learning (SSL) models into the first layer of residual vector quantization (RVQ-1) via semantic token assignment (STA). To further eliminate reliance on SSL-based semantic tokenizers and improve efficiency during inference, we propose a semantic pre-distillation (SPD) module, which predicts semantic tokens directly for assignment to the first RVQ layer during inference. Experimental results show that STACodec outperforms existing hybrid codecs in both audio reconstruction and downstream semantic tasks, demonstrating a better balance between acoustic fidelity and semantic capability."}

We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms.

However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines.

The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth.

In a study comparing laypeople, scientists, and two leading LLMs (ChatGPT-5 and DeepSeek), we found systematic differences in interpretation of generics. Compared to most scientists, laypeople judged scientific generics as more generalizable and credible, while LLMs rated them even higher. These mismatches highlight significant risks for science communication. Scientists may use generics and incorrectly assume laypeople share their interpretation, while LLMs may systematically overgeneralize scientific findings when summarizing research. Our findings underscore the need for greater attention to language choices in both human and LLM-mediated science communication."}

Compared with ensemble approaches, monolithic FID models are theoretically more promising, but to date, consistently yield inferior performance in practice. In this work, by discovering the ``heterogeneous phenomenon'', which is the intrinsic distinctness of artifacts across subdomains, we diagnose the cause of this underperformance for the first time: the collapse of the artifact feature space driven by such phenomenon. The core challenge for developing a practical monolithic FID model thus boils down to the ``unified-yet-discriminative\" reconstruction of the artifact feature space. To address this paradoxical challenge, we hypothesize that high-level semantics can serve as a structural prior for the reconstruction, and further propose Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), the first monolithic FID paradigm. Extensive experiments on our OpenMMSec dataset demonstrate that SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs the target unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space in a near-orthogonal manner, thus firmly validating our hypothesis.

While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the \"optimal\" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning."}

We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Such uncertainty is typically assessed using ensembles produced with physics based climate models. However, computational constraints impose a trade off between generating the large ensembles required for robust uncertainty estimation and increasing model resolution to better capture fine scale dynamics. Generative machine learning offers a promising pathway to alleviate these constraints. We develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) trained on a limited sample of climate simulations to generate arbitrary large ensembles. The approach is applied to output from monthly CMIP6 historical and future scenario experiments produced with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma's) Earth system model CanESM5. We show that the cVAE model learns the underlying distribution of the data and generates physically consistent samples that reproduce realistic low and high moment statistics, including extremes. Compared with more sophisticated generative architectures, cVAEs offer a mathematically transparent, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework. Their simplicity lead to some limitations, such as overly smooth outputs, spectral bias, and underdispersion, that we discuss along with strategies to mitigate them. Specifically, we show that incorporating output noise improves the representation of climate relevant multiscale variability, and we propose a simple method to achieve this.

However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception.

Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}

Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security."}

Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline.

This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL.

We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO.

Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes.

Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses \"thinking with images\" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\\times$ lower token budget."}

These protocols replace interactive, session-based authorization with cryptographically issued mandates, enabling asynchronous and autonomous execution. While AP2 provides specification-level guarantees through signature verification, explicit binding, and expiration semantics, real-world agentic execution introduces runtime behaviors such as retries, concurrency, and orchestration that challenge implicit assumptions about mandate usage.\n  In this work, we present a security analysis of the AP2 mandate lifecycle and identify enforcement gaps that arise during runtime in agent-based payment systems. We propose a zero-trust runtime verification framework that enforces explicit context binding and consume-once mandate semantics using dynamically generated, time-bound nonces, ensuring that authorization decisions are evaluated at execution time rather than assumed from static issuance properties.\n  Through simulation-based evaluation under high concurrency, we show that context-aware binding and consume-once enforcement address distinct and complementary attack classes, and that both are required to prevent replay and context-redirect attacks. The proposed framework mitigates all evaluated attacks while maintaining stable verification latency of approximately 3.8~ms at throughput levels up to 10{,}000 transactions per second. We further demonstrate that the required runtime state is bounded by peak concurrency rather than cumulative transaction history, indicating that robust runtime security for agentic payment execution can be achieved with minimal and predictable overhead."}

Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity.

We explore this question in the context of LLM-generated JITAIs, which are short, context-aware messages delivered at moments deemed appropriate to support behaviour change, using physical activity as an application domain. In a controlled retrospective study, 90 participants evaluated messages generated using four LLM strategies: baseline prompting, few-shot prompting, fine-tuned models, and retrieval augmented generation, each implemented with and without Big Five Personality Traits to produce personality-aligned communication across multiple scenarios. Using ordinal multilevel models with within-between decomposition, we distinguish trial-level effects, whether personality information improves evaluations of individual messages, from person-level exposure effects, whether participants receiving higher proportions of personality-informed messages exhibit systematically different overall perceptions. Results showed no trial-level associations, but participants who received higher proportions of BFPT-informed messages rated the messages as more personalised, appropriate, and reported less negative affect. We use Communication Accommodation Theory for post-hoc analysis. These results suggest that personality-based personalisation in behaviour change systems may operate primarily through aggregate exposure rather than per-message optimisation, with implications for how adaptive systems are designed and evaluated in sustained human-AI interaction.

To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction.

Furthermore, QSA naturally accommodates a constrained, trainable data-embedding that ties quantum state overlaps to data-level similarities. We find a gate complexity dominant scaling O(T d^2) for QSA, versus O(T^2 d) classically, suggesting an advantage in the practical regime where the sequence length T dominates the embedding size d.

We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1.

Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Existing remedies face a dichotomy: gradient surgery methods offer geometric safety but incur prohibitive computational costs via online projections, while efficient data selection approaches reduce overhead but remain blind to conflict-inducing gradient directions. In this paper, we propose Orthogonal Gradient Selection (OGS), a data-centric method that harmonizes domain performance, general capability retention, and training efficiency. OGS shifts the geometric insights of gradient projection from the optimizer to the data selection stage by treating data selection as a constrained decision-making process. By leveraging a lightweight Navigator model and reinforcement learning techniques, OGS dynamically identifies training samples whose gradients are orthogonal to a general-knowledge anchor. This approach ensures naturally safe updates for target models without modifying the optimizer or incurring runtime projection costs. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial domains demonstrate that OGS achieves excellent results, significantly improving domain performance and training efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance on general tasks such as GSM8K."}

We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases.

However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like \"Perceive-Reflect-Adjust\" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution. Through this observer-centric perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering a more realistic and flexible understanding of what makes an object truly \"salient.\" Code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Dustzx/OC_SOD"}

We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees."}

In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs."}

We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects.

Current safety measures predominantly focus on static input/output filtering. However, we argue that ensuring LLM agents reliability requires auditing the intermediate execution process. In this work, we formulate the task of Trajectory Anomaly Detection. The goal is not merely detection, but precise error localization. This capability is essential for enabling efficient rollback-and-retry. To achieve this, we construct TrajBench, a dataset synthesized via a perturb-and-complete strategy to cover diverse procedural anomalies. Using this benchmark, we investigate the capability of models in process supervision. We observe that general-purpose LLMs, even with zero-shot prompting, struggle to identify and localize these anomalies. This reveals that generalized capabilities do not automatically translate to process reliability. To address this, we propose TrajAD, a specialized verifier trained with fine-grained process supervision. Our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating that specialized supervision is essential for building trustworthy agents."}

However, when trained with sparse input views, 3DGS suffers from overfitting and structural degradation, leading to poor generalization on novel views. This limitation arises from its optimization relying solely on photometric loss without incorporating any 3D structure priors. To address this issue, we propose Coherent supergaussian Modeling with Spatial Priors (COSMOS). Inspired by the concept of superpoints from 3D segmentation, COSMOS introduces 3D structure priors by newly defining supergaussian groupings of Gaussians based on local geometric cues and appearance features. To this end, COSMOS applies inter group global self-attention across supergaussian groups and sparse local attention among individual Gaussians, enabling the integration of global and local spatial information. These structure-aware features are then used for predicting Gaussian attributes, facilitating more consistent 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, by leveraging supergaussian-based grouping, COSMOS enforces an intra-group positional regularization to maintain structural coherence and suppress floaters, thereby enhancing training stability under sparse-view conditions. Our experiments on Blender and DTU show that COSMOS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in sparse-view settings without any external depth supervision."}

To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks.

This progress naturally raises a critical yet unexplored question: can Multimodal dLLMs serve as effective multimodal embedding models? To answer this, we present the first systematic study of converting Multimodal dLLMs into embedding models. We evaluate state-of-the-art Multimodal dLLMs and Autoregressive VLMs across three categories of embedding tasks: classification, visual question answering, and information retrieval. Our results show that Multimodal dLLM embeddings generally underperform their autoregressive VLM counterparts. The stronger diffusion-based model, LaViDa, lags by only 3.5 points on classification, 2.5 points on VQA, and 4.4 points on retrieval tasks, whereas the other diffusion-based model, MMaDA, exhibits substantially larger performance gaps, exceeding 20 points across all tasks.

As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses. Extensive experiments show that UNO achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory-based baselines.

Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models."}

This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation."}

The model is trained on the richly annotated GraspNet-1Billion and SuctionNet-1Billion datasets, which have been aligned for the purpose, and generates graspability masks quantifying the suitability of each scene point for successful grasps. By sharing early-stage features while maintaining gripper-specific refiners, MultiGraspNet effectively leverages complementary information across grasping modalities, enhancing robustness and adaptability in cluttered scenes. We characterize MultiGraspNet's performance with an extensive experimental analysis, demonstrating its competitiveness with single-task models on relevant benchmarks. We run real-world experiments on a single-arm multi-gripper robotic setup showing that our approach outperforms the vacuum baseline, grasping 16% percent more seen objects and 32% more of the novel ones, while obtaining competitive results for the parallel task."}

A canonical failure mode is actuator inversion, where identical actions produce opposite physical effects under a latent binary context. We propose DMA*-SH, a framework where a single hypernetwork, trained solely via dynamics prediction, generates a small set of adapter weights shared across the dynamics model, policy, and action-value function. This shared modulation imparts an inductive bias matched to actuator inversion, while input/output normalization and random input masking stabilize context inference, promoting directionally concentrated representations. We provide theoretical support via an expressivity separation result for hypernetwork modulation, and a variance decomposition with policy-gradient variance bounds that formalize how within-mode compression improves learning under actuator inversion. For evaluation, we introduce the Actuator Inversion Benchmark (AIB), a suite of environments designed to isolate discontinuous context-to-dynamics interactions. On AIB's held-out actuator-inversion tasks, DMA*-SH achieves zero-shot generalization, outperforming domain randomization by 111.8% and surpassing a standard context-aware baseline by 16.1%."}

This early fusion lets embodied state participate in subsequent visual reasoning and token selection, biasing computation toward action-critical evidence while suppressing redundant visual tokens. In a systematic ablation over proprioception encoding, state entry point, and action-head conditioning, we find that text tokenization is more effective than learned projectors, and that retaining roughly 15% of visual tokens can match the performance of using the full token set.

This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding. This design enables fine-grained analysis of performance degradation under increasing environmental and task complexity; 2) A high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation, where each scene supports multiple fine-grained manipulation objectives to bridge the train-evaluation distribution gap. Experiments with representative VLA models reveal significant performance drops under cumulative perturbations, exposing persistent limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding. By integrating hierarchical evaluation with diverse training data, LIBERO-X offers a more reliable foundation for assessing and advancing VLA development."}

In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers."}

Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses \"thinking with images\" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\\times$ lower token budget."}

Among standard imaging planes, the four-chamber (4CH) view provides comprehensive information for CHD diagnosis, where clinicians carefully inspect the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases to evaluate cardiac structure and motion. Automated detection of these cardiac phases is thus a critical component toward fully automated CHD analysis. Yet, in the absence of fetal electrocardiography (ECG), manual identification of ED and ES frames remains a labor-intensive bottleneck. We present ORBIT (Orientation-Robust Beat Inference from Trajectories), a self-supervised framework that identifies cardiac phases without manual annotations under various fetal heart orientation. ORBIT employs registration as self-supervision task and learns a latent motion trajectory of cardiac deformation, whose turning points capture transitions between cardiac relaxation and contraction, enabling accurate and orientation-robust localization of ED and ES frames across diverse fetal positions. Trained exclusively on normal fetal echocardiography videos, ORBIT achieves consistent performance on both normal (MAE = 1.9 frames for ED and 1.6 for ES) and CHD cases (MAE = 2.4 frames for ED and 2.1 for ES), outperforming existing annotation-free approaches constrained by fixed orientation assumptions.

These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.\n  To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (ΔEntropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.\n  Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses ΔEntropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.\n  By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants."}

Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance.

Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\\ell_1$ or $\\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task.

Most existing initialization methods, such as Xavier and Kaiming initializations, rely on random sampling and do not exploit information from the optimization process itself. We propose a simple, yet effective, initialization strategy based on self-supervised pre-training using random noise as the target. Instead of directly training the network from random weights, we first pre-train it to fit random noise, which leads to a structured and non-random parameter configuration. We show that this noise-driven pre-training significantly improves convergence speed in subsequent tasks, without requiring additional data or changes to the network architecture. The proposed method is particularly effective for implicit neural representations (INRs) and Deep Image Prior (DIP)-style networks, which are known to exhibit a strong low-frequency bias during optimization. After noise-based pre-training, the network is able to capture high-frequency components much earlier in training, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Although random noise contains no semantic information, it serves as an effective self-supervised signal (considering its white spectrum nature) for shaping the initialization of neural networks. Overall, this work demonstrates that noise-based pre-training offers a lightweight and general alternative to traditional random initialization, enabling more efficient optimization of deep neural networks."}

Unfortunately, understanding and debugging such agents remain challenging due to their complex and dynamic nature.

The key insight of this paper is that debugging software development agents shares many similarities with conventional debugging of software programs, yet requires a higher level of abstraction that raises the level from low-level implementation details to high-level agent actions. Drawing on this insight, we introduce AgentStepper, the first interactive debugger for LLM-based software engineering agents. AgentStepper enables developers to inspect, control, and interactively manipulate agent trajectories. AgentStepper represents trajectories as structured conversations among an LLM, the agent program, and tools. It supports breakpoints, stepwise execution, and live editing of prompts and tool invocations, while capturing and displaying intermediate repository-level code changes. Our evaluation applies AgentStepper to three state-of-the-art software development agents, ExecutionAgent, SWE-Agent, and RepairAgent, showing that integrating the approach into existing agents requires minor code changes (39-42 edited lines). Moreover, we report on a user study with twelve participants, indicating that AgentStepper improves the ability of participants to interpret trajectories (64% vs. 67% mean performance) and identify bugs in the agent's implementation (17% vs. 60% success rate), while reducing perceived workload (e.g., frustration reduced from 5.4/7.0 to 2.4/7.0) compared to conventional tools."}

We explore this question in the context of LLM-generated JITAIs, which are short, context-aware messages delivered at moments deemed appropriate to support behaviour change, using physical activity as an application domain. In a controlled retrospective study, 90 participants evaluated messages generated using four LLM strategies: baseline prompting, few-shot prompting, fine-tuned models, and retrieval augmented generation, each implemented with and without Big Five Personality Traits to produce personality-aligned communication across multiple scenarios. Using ordinal multilevel models with within-between decomposition, we distinguish trial-level effects, whether personality information improves evaluations of individual messages, from person-level exposure effects, whether participants receiving higher proportions of personality-informed messages exhibit systematically different overall perceptions. Results showed no trial-level associations, but participants who received higher proportions of BFPT-informed messages rated the messages as more personalised, appropriate, and reported less negative affect. We use Communication Accommodation Theory for post-hoc analysis. These results suggest that personality-based personalisation in behaviour change systems may operate primarily through aggregate exposure rather than per-message optimisation, with implications for how adaptive systems are designed and evaluated in sustained human-AI interaction. In-situ longitudinal studies are needed to validate these findings in real-world contexts."}

Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) address these issues by iteratively expanding a restricted game with approximate best responses (BRs), yet per-agent BR training makes it prohibitively expensive in many-agent or simulator-expensive settings. We introduce Joint Experience Best Response (JBR), a drop-in modification to PSRO that collects trajectories once under the current meta-strategy profile and reuses this joint dataset to compute BRs for all agents simultaneously. This amortizes environment interaction and improves the sample efficiency of best-response computation. Because JBR converts BR computation into an offline RL problem, we propose three remedies for distribution-shift bias: (i) Conservative JBR with safe policy improvement, (ii) Exploration-Augmented JBR that perturbs data collection and admits theoretical guarantees, and (iii) Hybrid BR that interleaves JBR with periodic independent BR updates.

Applications with such strong requirement include information exchange between countries, medicine, banking, etc. This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-practice in this domain.\n  Objectives: The objective of this Systematic Review is to identify existing approaches for creating and evolving synthetic test data without using real-life raw data.\n  Methods: We followed well-known methodologies for conducting systematic literature reviews, including the ones from Kitchenham as well as guidelines for analysing the limitations of our review and its threats to validity.\n  Results: A variety of methods and tools exist for creating privacy-preserving test data. Our search found 1,013 publications in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SCOPUS. We extracted data from 75 of those publications and identified 37 approaches that answer our research question partly. A common prerequisite for using these methods and tools is direct access to real-life data for data anonymization or synthetic test data generation. Nine existing synthetic test data generation approaches were identified that were closest to answering our research question. Nevertheless, further work would be needed to add the ability to evolve synthetic test data to the existing approaches.\n  Conclusions: None of the publications really covered our requirements completely, only partially. Synthetic test data evolution is a field that has not received much attention from researchers but needs to be explored in Digital Government Solutions, especially since new legal regulations are being placed in force in many countries."}

We propose overlap geometry as an alternative trust region, constraining distributional overlap via the Bhattacharyya coefficient (closely related to the Hellinger/Renyi-1/2 geometry). This objective penalizes separation in the ratio tails, yielding tighter control over likelihood-ratio excursions without relying on total variation bounds that can be loose in tail regimes. We derive Bhattacharyya-TRPO (BTRPO) and Bhattacharyya-PPO (BPPO), enforcing overlap constraints via square-root ratio updates: BPPO clips the square-root ratio q = sqrt(r), and BTRPO applies a quadratic Hellinger/Bhattacharyya penalty. Empirically, overlap-based updates improve robustness and aggregate performance as measured by RLiable under matched training budgets, suggesting overlap constraints as a practical, principled alternative to KL for stable policy optimization."}

We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning."}

RAPID is built around a tool-free, modular hardware architecture that unifies handheld data collection and robot deployment, and a matching software stack that maintains real-time awareness of the underlying hardware configuration through a driver-level Physical Mask derived from USB events. This modular hardware architecture reduces reconfiguration to seconds and makes systematic multi-modal ablation studies practical, allowing researchers to sweep diverse gripper and sensing configurations without repeated system bring-up. The Physical Mask exposes modality presence as an explicit runtime signal, enabling auto-configuration and graceful degradation under sensor hot-plug events, so policies can continue executing when sensors are physically added or removed. System-centric experiments show that RAPID reduces the setup time for multi-modal configurations by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional workflows and preserves policy execution under runtime sensor hot-unplug events.

Mainstream approaches typically employ a dual-tower architecture between queries and items, and perform joint optimization of intra-tower and inter-tower tasks. However, we observe that joint optimization often leads to certain modalities dominating the training process, while other modalities are neglected. In addition, inconsistent training speeds across modalities can easily result in the one-epoch problem. To address these challenges, we propose a staged pretraining strategy, which guides the model to focus on specialized tasks at each stage, enabling it to effectively attend to and utilize multimodal features, and allowing flexible control over the training process at each stage to avoid the one-epoch problem. Furthermore, to better utilize the semantic IDs that compress high-dimensional multimodal embeddings, we design both generative and discriminative tasks to help the model understand the associations between SIDs, queries, and item features, thereby improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world Meituan data demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 3.80%, 2.64%, and 2.17% on R@5, R@10, and R@20, and 5.10%, 4.22%, and 2.09% on N@5, N@10, and N@20 compared to mainstream baselines.

To validate this hypothesis and decide which layers to restore, we design a proxy task -- Constrained Random Character(CRC) -- with an explicit validity set and a natural diversity objective. Results on CRC reveal a clear diversity-validity trade-off across restoration ranges and identify configurations that increase diversity with minimal quality loss. Based on these findings, we propose Selective Layer Restoration (SLR), a training-free method that restores selected layers in a post-trained model to their pre-trained weights, yielding a hybrid model with the same architecture and parameter count, incurring no additional inference cost. Across three different tasks (creative writing, open-ended question answering, and multi-step reasoning) and three different model families (Llama, Qwen, and Gemma), we find SLR can consistently and substantially improve output diversity while maintaining high output quality."}

SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability.

We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows.

Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail.

Our method creates mathematical ``abstractions'' by replacing each KAN unit with a piecewise affine (PWA) function, providing both local and global error estimates between the original network and its approximation. These abstractions enable property verification by encoding the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), determining whether outputs satisfy specified properties when inputs belong to a given set. A critical challenge lies in balancing the number of pieces in the PWA approximation: too many pieces add binary variables that make verification computationally intractable, while too few pieces create excessive error margins that yield uninformative bounds. Our key contribution is a systematic framework that exploits KAN structure to find optimal abstractions. By combining dynamic programming at the unit level with a knapsack optimization across the network, we minimize the total number of pieces while guaranteeing specified error bounds. This approach determines the optimal approximation strategy for each unit while maintaining overall accuracy requirements. Empirical evaluation across multiple KAN benchmarks demonstrates that the upfront analysis costs of our method are justified by superior verification results."}

Experimental results show that these rewards have the potential to improve models' task accuracy on difficult domains over models trained by general LLMs-as-judges by +45%, and approach performance of models trained by verifiable rewards while using as little as 20% as many gold labels. Through our approach, we extend the usage of reward rubrics from assessing qualitative model behavior to assessing quantitative model correctness on tasks typically learned via RLVR rewards. This extension opens the door for teaching models to solve complex technical problems without a full dataset of gold labels, which are often highly costly to procure."}

To overcome these challenges, we propose SuReNav, a superpixel graph-based constraint relaxation and navigation method that imitates human-like safe and efficient navigation. Our framework consists of three components: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using graph neural network trained on human demonstrations for safe and efficient navigation, and 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution for complete navigation. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art baselines on 2D semantic maps and 3D maps from OpenStreetMap, achieving the highest human-likeness score of complete navigation while maintaining a balanced trade-off between efficiency and safety. We finally demonstrate its scalability and generalization performance in real-world urban navigation with a quadruped robot, Spot."}

In this work, we introduce AI-OpenBMAT, the first dataset tailored to broadcast-style AI-music detection. It contains 3,294 one-minute audio excerpts (54.9 hours) that follow the duration patterns and loudness relations of real television audio, combining human-made production music with stylistically matched continuations generated with Suno v3.5. We benchmark a CNN baseline and state-of-the-art SpectTTTra models to assess SNR and duration robustness, and evaluate on a full broadcast scenario. Across all settings, models that excel in streaming scenarios suffer substantial degradation, with F1-scores dropping below 60% when music is in the background or has a short duration. These results highlight speech masking and short music length as critical open challenges for AI music detection, and position AI-OpenBMAT as a benchmark for developing detectors capable of meeting industrial broadcast requirements."}

These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.\n  To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (ΔEntropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.\n  Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses ΔEntropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.\n  By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants."}

We propose that representational sharing lies not in the concepts themselves, but in the geometric relations between them. Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces. Together, these results provide a mechanistic lens of how language models balance the shared structure of number representation with functional flexibility. It suggests that understanding arises when task-specific transformations are applied to a shared underlying relational structure of conceptual representations."}

Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking.

In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies. Extensive experiments in the zero-shot setting demonstrate that GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines, and even surpasses strong competitors that are few-shot fine-tuned with labeled data from the target domain."}

To overcome these challenges, we present TraceCoder, a collaborative multi-agent framework that emulates the observe-analyze-repair process of human experts. The framework first instruments the code with diagnostic probes to capture fine-grained runtime traces, enabling deep insight into its internal execution. It then conducts causal analysis on these traces to accurately identify the root cause of the failure. This process is further enhanced by a novel Historical Lesson Learning Mechanism (HLLM), which distills insights from prior failed repair attempts to inform subsequent correction strategies and prevent recurrence of similar mistakes. To ensure stable convergence, a Rollback Mechanism enforces that each repair iteration constitutes a strict improvement toward the correct solution. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that TraceCoder achieves up to a 34.43\\% relative improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over existing advanced baselines.

To this end, we introduce TamperBench, the first unified framework to systematically evaluate the tamper resistance of LLMs. TamperBench (i) curates a repository of state-of-the-art weight-space fine-tuning attacks and latent-space representation attacks; (ii) enables realistic adversarial evaluation through systematic hyperparameter sweeps per attack-model pair; and (iii) provides both safety and utility evaluations.

We use TamperBench to evaluate 21 open-weight LLMs, including defense-augmented variants, across nine tampering threats using standardized safety and capability metrics with hyperparameter sweeps per model-attack pair. This yields novel insights, including effects of post-training on tamper resistance, that jailbreak-tuning is typically the most severe attack, and that Triplet emerges as a leading alignment-stage defense.

Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations.

Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a \"subwords manifest\", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this \"subwords manifest\" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research."}

However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a distillation pipeline that accelerates DreamDojo to a real-time speed of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency. Our work enables several important applications based on generative world models, including live teleoperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning. Systematic evaluation on multiple challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks verifies the significance of our method for simulating open-world, contact-rich tasks, paving the way for general-purpose robot world models."}

Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance."}

Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating \"meta-models\" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases. These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions. Project page: https://generative-latent-prior.github.io."}
