Their joint predictive structure at the population level remains incompletely characterized. Objectives: The study aims to identify multilevel predictors of overweight and obesity among U.S. adolescents and compare the predictive performance, calibration, and subgroup equity of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Data and Methods: We analyze 18,792 children aged 10-17 years from the 2021 National Survey of Children's Health. Overweight/obesity is defined using BMI categories. Predictors included diet, physical activity, sleep, parental stress, socioeconomic conditions, adverse experiences, and neighborhood characteristics. Models include logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, multilayer perceptron, and TabNet. Performance is evaluated using AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Brier score. Results: Discrimination range from 0.66 to 0.79. Logistic regression, gradient boosting, and MLP showed the most stable balance of discrimination and calibration. Boosting and deep learning modestly improve recall and F1 score. No model was uniformly superior. Performance disparities across race and poverty groups persist across algorithms. Conclusion: Increased model complexity yields limited gains over logistic regression. Predictors consistently span behavioral, household, and neighborhood domains. Persistent subgroup disparities indicate the need for improved data quality and equity-focused surveillance rather than greater algorithmic complexity."}

Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings."}

In Phase II, this draft is audited and refined via conditional independence testing, with detected discrepancies guiding targeted edge revisions.\n  We evaluate our approach on three metadata-rich real-world benchmarks spanning industrial engineering, environmental monitoring, and IT systems analysis. Across these datasets, DMCD achieves competitive or leading performance against diverse causal discovery baselines, with particularly large gains in recall and F1 score.

Arrhythmia source localization is formulated as a three-class classification task, distinguishing normal sinus rhythm, left-sided, and right-sided arrhythmias, based on ICE video data. We developed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network trained to discriminate among the three aforementioned classes. In ten-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean accuracy of 66.2% when evaluated on four previously unseen patients (substantially outperforming the 33.3% random baseline). These results demonstrate the feasibility and clinical promise of using ICE videos combined with deep learning for automated arrhythmia localization. Leveraging ICE imaging could enable faster, more targeted electrophysiological interventions and reduce the procedural burden of cardiac ablation. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset to improve model robustness and generalizability across diverse patient populations."}

We present Implicit Intelligence, an evaluation framework testing whether AI agents can move beyond prompt-following to become genuine goal-fulfillers, paired with Agent-as-a-World (AaW), a harness where interactive worlds are defined in human-readable YAML files and simulated by language models. Our scenarios feature apparent simplicity in user requests, hidden complexity in correct solutions, and discoverability of constraints through environmental exploration.

While prior work has focused heavily on agent fine-tuning, tool interfaces-including natural language descriptions and parameter schemas-remain largely human-oriented and often become a bottleneck, especially when agents must select from large candidate tool sets. Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely on execution traces, which are frequently unavailable in cold-start or privacy-constrained settings, and typically optimize each tool independently, limiting scalability and generalization to unseen tools. We propose Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework that progressively transfers supervision from trace-rich settings to trace-free deployment, encouraging the model to abstract reusable interface-usage patterns and tool usage outcomes. To support this approach, we construct a large-scale dataset of high-quality tool interfaces using a structured workflow over a diverse collection of tools. Experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench show consistent gains on unseen tools, strong cross-domain generalization, and robustness as the number of candidate tools scales to over 100, demonstrating that tool interface optimization is a practical and deployable complement to agent fine-tuning."}

A common strategy is to train a reflection model as a filter to intercept false alerts with labelled data collected from user verification feedback. However, a key challenge is the noisy nature of such data as it is often collected in production environments. As cleaning noise via manual annotation incurs high costs, this paper proposes a novel method ConceptRM for constructing a high-quality corpus to train a reflection model capable of effectively intercepting false alerts. With only a small amount of expert annotations as anchors, ConceptRM creates perturbed datasets with varying noise ratios and utilizes co-teaching to train multiple distinct models for collaborative learning. By analyzing the consensus decisions of these models, it effectively identifies reliable negative samples from a noisy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptRM significantly enhances the interception of false alerts with minimal annotation cost, outperforming several state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 53.31% on in-domain datasets and 41.67% on out-of-domain datasets."}

Rule-based visualization linters can flag violations, but they miss context and do not suggest meaningful design changes.

In this work, we introduce a framework that combines chart de-rendering, automated analysis, and iterative improvement to deliver actionable, interpretable feedback on visualization design. Our system reconstructs the structure of a chart from an image, identifies design flaws using vision-language reasoning, and proposes concrete modifications supported by established principles in visualization research. Users can selectively apply these improvements and re-render updated figures, creating a feedback loop that promotes both higher-quality visualizations and the development of visualization literacy. In our evaluation on 1,000 charts from the Chart2Code benchmark, the system generated 10,452 design recommendations, which clustered into 10 coherent categories (e.g., axis formatting, color accessibility, legend consistency). These results highlight the promise of LLM-driven recommendation systems for delivering structured, principle-based feedback on visualization design, opening the door to more intelligent and accessible authoring tools."}

We extract over 671,000 question-answer pairs from 23,000 verified interview transcripts across 1,000 public personalities, each with an average of 11.5 hours of interview content. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework with four complementary metrics measuring content similarity, factual consistency, personality alignment, and factual knowledge retention. Through systematic comparison, we demonstrate that methods grounded in real interview data substantially outperform those relying solely on biographical profiles or the model's parametric knowledge. We further reveal a trade-off in how interview data is best utilized: retrieval-augmented methods excel at capturing personality style and response quality, while chronological-based methods better preserve factual consistency and knowledge retention.

Specifically, N4MC converts consecutive irregular mesh frames into regular 4D tensors to provide a uniform and compact representation. These tensors are then condensed using an auto-decoder, which captures both spatial and temporal correlations for redundancy removal. To enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a transformer-based interpolation model that predicts intermediate mesh frames conditioned on latent embeddings derived from tracked volume centers, eliminating motion ambiguities. Extensive evaluations show that N4MC outperforms state-of-the-art in rate-distortion performance, while enabling real-time decoding of 4D mesh sequences.

We operationalize this insight by constructing a 22-dimension query feature vector covering clause complexity, lexical rarity, and anaphora, negation, answerability, and intention grounding, all known to affect human comprehension. Using 369,837 real-world queries, we ask: Are there certain types of queries that make hallucination more likely? A large-scale analysis reveals a consistent \"risk landscape\": certain features such as deep clause nesting and underspecification align with higher hallucination propensity. In contrast, clear intention grounding and answerability align with lower hallucination rates. Others, including domain specificity, show mixed, dataset- and model-dependent effects. Thus, these findings establish an empirically observable query-feature representation correlated with hallucination risk, paving the way for guided query rewriting and future intervention studies."}

Common image priors promote solutions on the general image manifold, such as sparsity, smoothness, or score function. However, as these priors do not constrain the null-space component, they can bias the reconstruction. Thus, we aim to incorporate meaningful null-space information in the reconstruction framework. Inspired by smooth image representation on graphs, we propose Graph-Smooth Null-Space Representation (GSNR), a mechanism that imposes structure only into the invisible component. Particularly, given a graph Laplacian, we construct a null-restricted Laplacian that encodes similarity between neighboring pixels in the null-space signal, and we design a low-dimensional projection matrix from the $p$-smoothest spectral graph modes (lowest graph frequencies). This approach has strong theoretical and practical implications: i) improved convergence via a null-only graph regularizer, ii) better coverage, how much null-space variance is captured by $p$ modes, and iii) high predictability, how well these modes can be inferred from the measurements. GSNR is incorporated into well-known inverse problem solvers, e.g., PnP, DIP, and diffusion solvers, in four scenarios: image deblurring, compressed sensing, demosaicing, and image super-resolution, providing consistent improvement of up to 4.3 dB over baseline formulations and up to 1 dB compared with end-to-end learned models in terms of PSNR."}

We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

We reveal that distinct visual feature circuits can handle mathematical reasoning and support cross-modal associations. Validated through feature steering and circuit patching, our framework proves these circuits are causal and controllable, laying the groundwork for more explainable and reliable VLMs."}

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io."}

The study focuses on balancing classification accuracy with computational efficiency, a key consideration when integrating AI into real world automation pipelines. Three models of varying complexity were examined: a Naive Bayes classifier, a bidirectional LSTM network, and a fine tuned transformer based BERT model.\n  The experiments reveal substantial differences in performance. BERT achieved the highest accuracy, consistently exceeding 99\\%, but required significantly longer training times and greater computational resources. The BiLSTM model provided a strong compromise, reaching approximately 98.56\\% accuracy while maintaining moderate training costs and offering robust contextual understanding. Naive Bayes proved to be the fastest to train, on the order of milliseconds, yet delivered the lowest accuracy, averaging around 94.5\\%. Class imbalance influenced all methods, particularly in the recognition of minority categories.\n  A fully functional demonstrative system was implemented to validate practical applicability, enabling automated routing of technical requests with throughput unattainable through manual processing. The study concludes that BiLSTM offers the most balanced solution for the examined scenario, while also outlining opportunities for future improvements and further exploration of transformer architectures."}

We propose a data-centric framework that learns verbalization for LLM-based recommendation. Using reinforcement learning, a verbalization agent transforms raw interaction histories into optimized textual contexts, with recommendation accuracy as the training signal. This agent learns to filter noise, incorporate relevant metadata, and reorganize information to improve downstream predictions. Experiments on a large-scale industrial streaming dataset show that learned verbalization delivers up to 93% relative improvement in discovery item recommendation accuracy over template-based baselines. Further analysis reveals emergent strategies such as user interest summarization, noise removal, and syntax normalization, offering insights into effective context construction for LLM-based recommender systems."}

We introduce CausalReasoningBenchmark, a benchmark of 173 queries across 138 real-world datasets, curated from 85 peer-reviewed research papers and four widely-used causal-inference textbooks. For each query a system must produce (i) a structured identification specification that names the strategy, the treatment, outcome, and control variables, and all design-specific elements, and (ii) a point estimate with a standard error. By scoring these two components separately, our benchmark enables granular diagnosis: it distinguishes failures in causal reasoning from errors in numerical execution. Baseline results with a state-of-the-art LLM show that, while the model correctly identifies the high-level strategy in 84 % of cases, full identification-specification correctness drops to only 30 %, revealing that the bottleneck lies in the nuanced details of research design rather than in computation.

For video generators to be useful for applications ranging from robotics to film-making, they must consistently produce realistic videos. However, evaluating the realism of generated videos remains a largely manual process -- requiring human annotation or bespoke evaluation datasets which have restricted scope. Here we develop an automated evaluation framework for video realism which captures both semantics and coherent 3D structure and which does not require access to a reference video. Our method, 3DSPA, is a 3D spatiotemporal point autoencoder which integrates 3D point trajectories, depth cues, and DINO semantic features into a unified representation for video evaluation. 3DSPA models how objects move and what is happening in the scene, enabling robust assessments of realism, temporal consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments show that 3DSPA reliably identifies videos which violate physical laws, is more sensitive to motion artifacts, and aligns more closely with human judgments of video quality and realism across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that enriching trajectory-based representations with 3D semantics offers a stronger foundation for benchmarking generative video models, and implicitly captures physical rule violations.

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate. Across two architecturally distinct MLLMs, we show that multimodal inputs can reinforce modality dominance rather than mitigate it, as revealed by structured error-attractor patterns under systematic label perturbation, complemented by dynamical analysis."}

Yet, their utility for estimating downstream performance remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate the relationship between model performance and the unembedding matrix geometry, particularly its effective rank. Our experiments, involving a suite of 108 OLMo-style language models trained under controlled variation, reveal several key findings. While the best-performing models often exhibit a high effective rank, this trend is not universal across tasks and training setups. Contrary to prior work, we find that low effective rank does not cause late-stage performance degradation in small models, but instead co-occurs with it; we find adversarial cases where low-rank models do not exhibit saturation. Moreover, we show that effective rank is strongly influenced by pre-training hyperparameters, such as batch size and weight decay, which in-turn affect the model's performance. Lastly, extending our analysis to other geometric metrics and final-layer representation, we find that these metrics are largely aligned, but none can reliably predict downstream performance. Overall, our findings suggest that the model's geometry, as captured by existing metrics, primarily reflects training choices rather than performance."}

In this work, we introduce the notion of 3D aesthetic field that enables geometry-grounded aesthetic reasoning in 3D with sparse captures, allowing efficient viewpoint suggestions in contrast to costly RL searches. We opt to learn this 3D aesthetic field using a feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting network that distills high-level aesthetic knowledge from a pretrained 2D aesthetic model into 3D space, enabling aesthetic prediction for novel viewpoints from only sparse input views. Building on this field, we propose a two-stage search pipeline that combines coarse viewpoint sampling with gradient-based refinement, efficiently identifying aesthetically appealing viewpoints without dense captures or RL exploration. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently suggests viewpoints with superior framing and composition compared to existing approaches, establishing a new direction toward 3D-aware aesthetic modeling."}

Untrusted monitoring -- using one untrusted model to oversee another -- is one approach to reducing risk. Justifying the safety of an untrusted monitoring deployment is challenging because developers cannot safely deploy a misaligned model to test their protocol directly. In this paper, we develop upon existing methods for rigorously demonstrating safety based on pre-deployment testing. We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring. We develop a taxonomy covering passive self-recognition, causal collusion (hiding pre-shared signals), acausal collusion (hiding signals via Schelling points), and combined strategies. We create a safety case sketch to clearly present our argument, explicitly state our assumptions, and highlight unsolved challenges. We identify conditions under which passive self-recognition could be a more effective collusion strategy than those studied previously. Our work builds towards more robust evaluations of untrusted monitoring."}

Although a growing set of metrics capture many of these considerations, they are rarely organized in a way that supports consistent evaluation, leaving no unified taxonomy for assessing and comparing LLM utility across use cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Language Model Utility Taxonomy (LUX), a comprehensive framework that structures utility evaluation across four domains: performance, interaction, operations, and governance. Within each domain, LUX is organized hierarchically into thematically aligned dimensions and components, each grounded in metrics that enable quantitative comparison and alignment of model selection with intended use. In addition, an external dynamic web tool is provided to support exploration of the framework by connecting each component to a repository of relevant metrics (factors) for applied evaluation."}

Recovering a coherent image from a burst of such frames requires handling alignment, denoising, and demosaicing (for color) under noise statistics far outside those assumed by standard restoration pipelines or modern generative models. We present an approach that adapts large text-to-image latent diffusion models to the photon-limited domain of quanta burst imaging.

Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once for high-level intent, the VLM provides task specification, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5% and 37.5% higher success on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to π0. It also reduces inference latency by up to 5x relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show that the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5% to 77.5%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of belief-based state representations for long-horizon VLA policies."}

However, existing benchmarks for VLM-driven embodied agents often rely on high-level commands or discretized action spaces, which are non-native settings that differ markedly from real-world control. In addition, current benchmarks focus primarily on high-level tasks and lack joint evaluation and analysis at both low and high levels. To address these limitations, we present NativeEmbodied, a challenging benchmark for VLM-driven embodied agents that uses a unified, native low-level action space. Built on diverse simulated scenes, NativeEmbodied includes three representative high-level tasks in complex scenarios to evaluate overall performance. For more detailed analysis, we further decouple the skills required by complex tasks and construct four types of low-level tasks, each targeting a fundamental embodied skill. This joint evaluation across task and skill granularities enables fine-grained assessment of embodied agents. Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal clear deficiencies in several fundamental embodied skills, and further analysis shows that these bottlenecks significantly limit performance on high-level tasks. NativeEmbodied highlights key challenges for current VLM-driven embodied agents and provides insights to guide future research."}

Circuitousness shows strong raw correlation (rho = 0.41) but is 93 percent correlated with length; after control, partial rho drops to 0.11--demonstrating that naive correlations in corpus studies can be dominated by length confounds. Genre strongly constrains narrative shape (chi squared = 2121.6, p < 10 to the power negative 242), with fiction maintaining plateau profiles while nonfiction front-loads information. Historical analysis shows books became progressively more predictable between 1840 and 1910 (T/I ratio trend r = negative 0.74, p = 0.037).

We propose SceMoS, a scene-aware motion synthesis framework that shows that structured 2D scene representations can serve as a powerful alternative to full 3D supervision in physically grounded motion synthesis. SceMoS disentangles global planning from local execution using lightweight 2D cues and relying on (1) a text-conditioned autoregressive global motion planner that operates on a bird's-eye-view (BEV) image rendered from an elevated corner of the scene, encoded with DINOv2 features, as the scene representation, and (2) a geometry-grounded motion tokenizer trained via a conditional VQ-VAE, that uses 2D local scene heightmap, thus embedding surface physics directly into a discrete vocabulary. This 2D factorization reaches an efficiency-fidelity trade-off: BEV semantics capture spatial layout and affordance for global reasoning, while local heightmaps enforce fine-grained physical adherence without full 3D volumetric reasoning. SceMoS achieves state-of-the-art motion realism and contact accuracy on the TRUMANS benchmark, reducing the number of trainable parameters for scene encoding by over 50%, showing that 2D scene cues can effectively ground 3D human-scene interaction."}

However, most existing alignment approaches operate at training time and rely on additional high-quality data, incurring significant computational and annotation costs. While recent work has shown that contrastive decoding can leverage a model's internal distributions to improve specific capabilities, its applicability remains limited to narrow behavioral scopes and scenarios. In this work, we introduce Polarity-Prompt Contrastive Decoding (PromptCD), a test-time behavior control method that generalizes contrastive decoding to broader enhancement settings. PromptCD constructs paired positive and negative guiding prompts for a target behavior and contrasts model responses-specifically token-level probability distributions in LLMs and visual attention patterns in VLMs-to reinforce desirable outcomes. This formulation extends contrastive decoding to a wide range of enhancement objectives and is applicable to both LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without additional training. For LLMs, experiments on the \"3H\" alignment objectives (helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements, indicating that post-trained models can achieve meaningful self-enhancement purely at test time. For VLMs, we further analyze contrastive effects on visual attention, showing that PromptCD significantly improves VQA performance by reinforcing behavior-consistent visual grounding. Collectively, these results highlight PromptCD as a simple, general, and cost-efficient strategy for reliable behavior control across modalities."}

To this end, we propose path-decoupled Hyperbolic Flow Matching (HFM), leveraging the Lorentz manifold's exponential expansion for trajectory decoupling. HFM structures the transport via two key designs: 1) Centripetal hyperbolic alignment: It constructs a centripetal hierarchy by anchoring textual roots, which pushes visual leaves to the boundary to initialize orderly flows. 2) Path-decoupled objective: It acts as a ``semantic guardrail'' rigidly confining trajectories within isolated class-specific geodesic corridors via step-wise supervision. Furthermore, we devise an adaptive diameter-based stopping to prevent over-transportation into the crowded origin based on the intrinsic semantic scale. Extensive ablations on 11 benchmarks have shown that HFM establishes a new state-of-the-art, consistently outperforming its Euclidean counterparts. Our codes and models will be released."}

This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $β$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $β= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $β= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $β$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.\n  We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art."}

Building on this insight, we propose CAMEL, a confidence-gated reflection framework that performs a lightweight single-token preference decision first and selectively invokes reflection only for low-confidence instances. To induce effective self-correction, we train the model via reinforcement learning with counterfactual prefix augmentation, which exposes the model to diverse initial verdicts and encourages genuine revision.

Its core innovation lies in extracting and reusing clustered parameter groups from the pretrained weight matrix. These groups are then used to form multiple low-rank components, all of which share only a single initialized trainable low-rank matrix. This approach cuts the number of trainable parameters while keeping the model's capacity intact.

In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST. These results suggest that CST can improve CoT faithfulness in general, with promising applications for CoT monitoring.

We find that models like DINO inherently encode part-level geometric structures, while generative models like Flux contain rich, verb-conditioned spatial attention maps that serve as implicit interaction priors. Crucially, we demonstrate that these two dimensions are not merely correlated but are composable elements of affordance. By simply fusing DINO's geometric prototypes with Flux's interaction maps in a training-free and zero-shot manner, we achieve affordance estimation competitive with weakly-supervised methods. This final fusion experiment confirms that geometric and interaction perception are the fundamental building blocks of affordance understanding in VFMs, providing a mechanistic account of how perception grounds action."}

Existing models capture features by learning from large corpora with transformer models, which are computationally intensive and unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. Therefore, our proposed study incorporates comprehensive grammatical rules alongside semantic information to build a robust, lightweight classification model without resorting to full parameterised transformer models or heavy deep learning architectures. The novelty of our approach lies in its explicit encoding of sentence-level grammatical structure, including syntactic composition, phrase patterns, and complexity indicators, into a compact grammar vector, which is then fused with frozen contextual embeddings. These heterogeneous elements unified a single representation that captures both the structural and semantic characteristics of the text. Deep learning models such as Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), BiLSTMs, and transformer-based BERT and XLNET were used to train and evaluate the model, with the number of epochs varied. Based on experimental results, the unified feature representation model captures both the semantic and structural properties of text, outperforming baseline models by 2%-15%, enabling more effective learning across heterogeneous domains. Unlike prior syntax-aware transformer models that inject grammatical structure through additional attention layers, tree encoders, or full fine-tuning, the proposed framework treats grammar as an explicit inductive bias rather than a learnable module, resulting in a very lightweight model that delivers better performance on edge devices"}

We introduced an explanation model for segmentation task which employs the causal inference framework and backpropagates the average treatment effect (ATE) into a quantification metric to determine the influence of input regions, as well as network components, on target segmentation areas. Through comparison with recent segmentation explainability techniques on two representative medical imaging datasets, we demonstrated that our approach provides more faithful explanations than existing approaches. Furthermore, we carried out a systematic causal analysis of multiple foundational segmentation models using our method, which reveals significant heterogeneity in perceptual strategies across different models, and even between different inputs for the same model.

At the representation level, a dual-view graph learning module augments the interaction graph with content-induced edges, improving coverage for sparse and long-tail items while preserving collaborative structure via parallel encoding and lightweight fusion. At the fusion level, MAGNET employs structured experts with explicit modality roles -- dominant, balanced, and complementary -- enabling a more interpretable and adaptive combination of behavioral, visual, and textual cues. To further stabilize sparse routing and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a two-stage entropy-weighting mechanism that monitors routing entropy. This mechanism automatically transitions training from an early coverage-oriented regime to a later specialization-oriented regime, progressively balancing expert utilization and routing confidence.

We present SibylSense, an inference-time learning approach that adapts a frozen rubric generator through a tunable memory bank of validated rubric items. Memory is updated via verifier-based item rewards measured by reference-candidate answer discriminative gaps from a handful of examples. SibylSense alternates memory tuning with a rubric-adversarial policy update that produces rubric-satisfying candidate answers, shrinking discriminative gaps and driving the rubric generator to capture new quality dimensions.

More recently, RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can generate preference labels at scale, mitigating the reliance on human annotators. However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal. In this paper, we explore the extension of the RLAIF paradigm to multi-objective self-adaptive systems.

We propose a new tail-aware divergence that decouples the contribution of the teacher model's top-K predicted probabilities from that of lower-probability predictions, while maintaining the same computational profile as the KL Divergence. Our decoupled approach reduces the impact of the teacher modes and, consequently, increases the contribution of the tail of the distribution.

Inspired by biological center-surround organization and frequency-selective signal processing, we propose PFGNet, a fully convolutional framework that dynamically modulates receptive fields through pixel-wise frequency-guided gating. The core Peripheral Frequency Gating (PFG) block extracts localized spectral cues and adaptively fuses multi-scale large-kernel peripheral responses with learnable center suppression, effectively forming spatially adaptive band-pass filters.

Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, while deep learning (DL) approaches, though accurate, remain vulnerable to sample quality variations and artifacts. Building on our earlier CNN-based framework (Beznik et al., 2020), we evaluated YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 for CFU detection; however, these achieved only 97.08 percent accuracy, insufficient for pharmaceutical-grade requirements. A custom Detectron2 model trained on GSK's dataset of over 50,000 Petri dish images achieved 99 percent detection rate with 2 percent false positives and 0.6 percent false negatives. Despite high validation accuracy, Detectron2 performance degrades on outlier cases including contaminated plates, plastic artifacts, or poor optical clarity. To address this, we developed a multi-agent framework combining DL with vision-language models (VLMs). The VLM agent first classifies plates as valid or invalid. For valid samples, both DL and VLM agents independently estimate colony counts. When predictions align within 5 percent, results are automatically recorded in Postgres and SAP; otherwise, samples are routed for expert review. Expert feedback enables continuous retraining and self-improvement. Initial DL-based automation reduced human verification by 50 percent across vaccine manufacturing sites. With VLM integration, this increased to 85 percent, delivering significant operational savings.

We find that these neurons set the upper limits for the maximum potential strength of adversarial attacks and are prone to state-flipping under minor disturbances. To address this challenge, we propose a Threshold Guarding Optimization (TGO) method, which comprises two key aspects. First, we incorporate additional constraints into the loss function to move neurons' membrane potentials away from their thresholds. It increases SNNs' gradient sparsity, thereby reducing the theoretical upper bound of adversarial attacks. Second, we introduce noisy spiking neurons to transition the neuronal firing mechanism from deterministic to probabilistic, decreasing their state-flipping probability due to minor disturbances. Extensive experiments conducted in standard adversarial scenarios prove that our method significantly enhances the robustness of directly trained SNNs.

We prove that every forward model in a broad, precisely defined operator class Cimg (encompassing clinical, scientific, and industrial imaging modalities, both linear and nonlinear) admits an epsilon-approximate representation as a typed directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are drawn from a library of exactly 11 canonical primitives: Propagate, Modulate, Project, Encode, Convolve, Accumulate, Detect, Sample, Disperse, Scatter, and Transform. We call this the Finite Primitive Basis Theorem. The proof is constructive: we provide an algorithm that, given any H in Cimg, produces a DAG G with relative operator error at most epsilon and graph complexity within prescribed bounds. We further prove that the library is minimal: removing any single primitive causes at least one modality to lose its epsilon-approximate representation. A systematic analysis of nonlinearities in imaging physics shows they fall into two structural categories: pointwise scalar functions (handled by Transform) and self-consistent iterations (unrolled into existing linear primitives).

BLMs are multiple-choice problems, structured at multiple levels: within each sentence, across the input sequence, within each candidate answer. Because of their rich structure, these curated, but naturalistic datasets are key to answer some core questions about current large language models abilities: do LLMs detect linguistic objects and their properties? Do they detect and use systematic patterns across sentences? Are they more prone to linguistic or reasoning errors, and how do these interact?\n  We show that BLMs, while challenging, can be solved at good levels of performance, in more than one language, with simple baseline models or, at better performance levels, with more tailored models. We show that their representations contain the grammatical objects and attributes relevant to solve a linguistic task. We also show that these solutions are reached by detecting systematic patterns across sentences.\n  The paper supports the point of view that curated, structured datasets support multi-faceted investigations of properties of language and large language models. Because they present a curated, articulated structure, because they comprise both learning contexts and expected answers, and because they are partly built by hand, BLMs fall in the category of datasets that can support explainability investigations, and be useful to ask why large language models behave the way they do."}

While image exemplars provide an alternative, they primarily encode appearance cues such as color and texture, which are often unrelated to a part's geometric identity. In industrial settings, a single component may be produced in different materials, finishes, or colors, making appearance-based prompting unreliable. In contrast, such objects are typically defined by precise CAD models that capture their canonical geometry. We propose a CAD-prompted segmentation framework built on SAM3 that uses canonical multi-view renderings of a CAD model as prompt input. The rendered views provide geometry-based conditioning independent of surface appearance. The model is trained using synthetic data generated from mesh renderings in simulation under diverse viewpoints and scene contexts. Our approach enables single-stage, CAD-prompted mask prediction, extending promptable segmentation to objects that cannot be robustly described by language or appearance alone."}

While alignment failures increasingly cause real-world harm, comprehensive evaluation frameworks with realistic multi-turn scenarios remain lacking. We introduce an alignment benchmark spanning 904 scenarios across six categories -- Honesty, Safety, Non-Manipulation, Robustness, Corrigibility, and Scheming -- validated as realistic by human raters. Our scenarios place models under conflicting instructions, simulated tool access, and multi-turn escalation to reveal behavioural tendencies that single-turn evaluations miss. Evaluating 24 frontier models using LLM judges validated against human annotations, we find that even top-performing models exhibit gaps in specific categories, while the majority of models show consistent weaknesses across the board. Factor analysis reveals that alignment behaves as a unified construct (analogous to the g-factor in cognitive research) with models scoring high on one category tending to score high on others. We publicly release the benchmark and an interactive leaderboard to support ongoing evaluation, with plans to expand scenarios in areas where we observe persistent weaknesses and to add new models as they are released."}

However, most existing datasets primarily focus on linear reasoning, neglecting other parts such as proof by contradiction and proof by cases, which are crucial for investigating LLMs' reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we first introduce a novel first-order logic (FOL) dataset named PC-FOL, annotated by professional mathematicians, focusing on case-based reasoning problems. All instances in this dataset are equipped with a manually written natural language proof, clearly distinguishing it from conventional linear reasoning datasets. Our experimental results over leading LLMs demonstrate a substantial performance gap between linear reasoning and case-based reasoning problems. To further investigate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis grounded in graphical model, which provides an explanation for the observed disparity between the two types of reasoning problems. We hope this work can reveal the core challenges in the field of automated natural language mathematical proof generation, paving the way for future research."}

To tackle these issues, we introduce WildGHand, an optimization-based framework that enables self-adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting on in-the-wild videos and produces high-fidelity hand avatars. WildGHand incorporates two key components: (i) a dynamic perturbation disentanglement module that explicitly represents perturbations as time-varying biases on 3D Gaussian attributes during optimization, and (ii) a perturbation-aware optimization strategy that generates per-frame anisotropic weighted masks to guide optimization. Together, these components allow the framework to identify and suppress perturbations across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further curate a dataset of monocular hand videos captured under diverse perturbations to benchmark in-the-wild hand avatar reconstruction. Extensive experiments on this dataset and two public datasets demonstrate that WildGHand achieves state-of-the-art performance and substantially improves over its base model across multiple metrics (e.g., up to a $15.8\\%$ relative gain in PSNR and a $23.1\\%$ relative reduction in LPIPS).

We introduce Vision-Language Causal Graphs (VLCGs), a structured, query-conditioned representation that explicitly encodes causally relevant objects, attributes, relations, and scene-grounded assumptions. Building on this representation, we present ViLCaR, a diagnostic benchmark comprising tasks for Causal Attribution, Causal Inference, and Question Answering, along with graph-aligned evaluation metrics that assess relevance identification beyond final answer accuracy. Experiments in state-of-the-art LVLMs show that injecting structured relevance information significantly improves attribution and inference consistency compared to zero-shot and standard in-context learning.

We consider the effect of prior exposure to visual images (i.e., visual context) on these judgments for humans and large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that, in contrast to textual context, visual images appear to have little if any impact on human acceptability ratings. However, LLMs display the compression effect seen in previous work on human judgments in document contexts. Different sorts of LLMs are able to predict human acceptability judgments to a high degree of accuracy, but in general, their performance is slightly better when visual contexts are removed. Moreover, the distribution of LLM judgments varies among models, with Qwen resembling human patterns, and others diverging from them. LLM-generated predictions on sentence acceptability are highly correlated with their normalised log probabilities in general. However, the correlations decrease when visual contexts are present, suggesting that a higher gap exists between the internal representations of LLMs and their generated predictions in the presence of visual contexts. Our experimental work suggests interesting points of similarity and of difference between human and LLM processing of sentences in multimodal contexts."}

This study proposes a hybrid approach that uses LLMs for aspect identification while employing classic machine-learning methods for sentiment classification at scale. Using ChatGPT to analyze sampled restaurant reviews, we identified key aspects of dining experiences and developed sentiment classifiers using human-labeled reviews, which we subsequently applied to 4.7 million reviews collected over 17 years from a major online platform. Regression analysis reveals that our machine-labeled aspects significantly explain variance in overall restaurant ratings across different aspects of dining experiences, cuisines, and geographical regions. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLMs with traditional machine learning approaches can effectively automate aspect-based sentiment analysis of large-scale customer feedback, suggesting a practical framework for both researchers and practitioners in the hospitality industry and potentially, other service sectors."}

Graph-based RAG approaches attempt to bridge this gap, yet they typically face trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency due to challenges such as costly graph traversals and semantic noise in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we propose HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization strategies for GraphRAG (HELP), a novel framework designed to balance accuracy with practical efficiency through two core strategies: 1) HyperNode Expansion, which iteratively chains knowledge triplets into coherent reasoning paths abstracted as HyperNodes to capture complex structural dependencies and ensure retrieval accuracy; and 2) Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization, which leverages precomputed graph-text correlations to map these paths directly to the corpus for superior efficiency. HELP avoids expensive random walks and semantic distortion, preserving knowledge integrity while drastically reducing retrieval latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HELP achieves competitive performance across multiple simple and multi-hop QA benchmarks and up to a 28.8$\\times$ speedup over leading Graph-based RAG baselines."}

The source latent serves as structural information of the video, while the edited latent provides the target transformation for learning propagation. Our pipeline enables an additional adapter attached to the pre-trained VDM to learn to propagate edits via Guidance-Modulated Flow Matching (GMFM) loss, which guides the model to replicate the target transformation.

In this paper, we show that the primary limitation of current approaches lies in their reliance on post-hoc alignment of independently reconstructed sessions, which is insufficient under large temporal appearance change. We address this limitation by enforcing cross-session correspondences directly within a joint SfM reconstruction. Our approach combines complementary handcrafted and learned visual features to robustly establish correspondences across large temporal gaps, enabling the reconstruction of a single coherent 3D model from imagery captured years apart, where standard independent and joint SfM pipelines break down. We evaluate our method on long-term coral reef datasets exhibiting significant real-world change, and demonstrate consistent joint reconstruction across sessions in cases where existing methods fail to produce coherent reconstructions. To ensure scalability to large datasets, we further restrict expensive learned feature matching to a small set of likely cross-session image pairs identified via visual place recognition, which reduces computational cost and improves alignment robustness."}

Furthermore, we find that successful reasoning at scale is contingent upon precise tool calls, identifying tool design as a critical capability for LLMs to achieve general superintelligence through the Diligent Learner framework."}

Aphasia may impair the use and comprehension of written and spoken language. The Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R) is an assessment tool administered by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to evaluate the aphasia type and severity. Because the WAB-R measures isolated linguistic skills, there has been growing interest in the assessment of discourse production as a more holistic representation of everyday language abilities. Recent advancements in speech analysis focus on automated estimation of aphasia severity from spontaneous speech, relying mostly in isolated linguistic or acoustical features. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based framework for estimating aphasia severity. We represented each participant's discourse as a directed multi-modal graph, where nodes represent lexical items and gestures and edges encode word-word, gesture-word, and word-gesture transitions. GraphSAGE is employed to learn participant-level embeddings, thus integrating information from immediate neighbors and overall graph structure. Our results suggest that aphasia severity is not encoded in isolated lexical distribution, but rather emerges from structured interactions between speech and gesture. The proposed architecture offers a reliable automated aphasia assessment, with possible uses in bedside screening and telehealth-based monitoring."}

One fundamental challenge in this area involves accurately parsing hands and active objects. While transformer-based architectures have demonstrated considerable potential for such tasks, several key limitations remain unaddressed: 1) existing query initialization mechanisms rely primarily on semantic cues or learnable parameters, demonstrating limited adaptability to changing active objects across varying input scenes; 2) previous transformer-based methods utilize pixel-level semantic features to iteratively refine queries during mask generation, which may introduce interaction-irrelevant content into the final embeddings; and 3) prevailing models are susceptible to \"interaction illusion\", producing physically inconsistent predictions. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Interaction-aware Transformer (InterFormer), which integrates three key components, i.e., a Dynamic Query Generator (DQG), a Dual-context Feature Selector (DFS), and the Conditional Co-occurrence (CoCo) loss. The DQG explicitly grounds query initialization in the spatial dynamics of hand-object contact, enabling targeted generation of interaction-aware queries for hands and various active objects. The DFS fuses coarse interactive cues with semantic features, thereby suppressing interaction-irrelevant noise and emphasizing the learning of interactive relationships. The CoCo loss incorporates hand-object relationship constraints to enhance physical consistency in prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the EgoHOS and the challenging out-of-distribution mini-HOI4D datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization ability. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/yuggiehk/InterFormer."}

Inspired by the interplay of emotions and cognition in the human brain and more specifically the SEEKING motivational state, we design a dual-model framework where a smaller base model is trained continuously, while a larger motivated model is activated intermittently during predefined \"motivation conditions\". The framework mimics the emotional state of high curiosity and anticipation of reward in which broader brain regions are recruited to enhance cognitive performance. Exploiting scalable architectures where larger models extend smaller ones, our method enables shared weight updates and selective expansion of network capacity during noteworthy training steps. Empirical evaluation on the image classification task demonstrates that, not only does the alternating training scheme efficiently and effectively enhance the base model compared to a traditional scheme, in some cases, the motivational model also surpasses its standalone counterpart despite seeing less data per epoch. This opens the possibility of simultaneously training two models tailored to different deployment constraints with competitive or superior performance while keeping training cost lower than when training the larger model."}

However, it has been observed that the calibration parameters for quantization are typically linked to specific precisions, which presents challenges during elastic-precision calibration and precision switching at runtime. In this work, we attribute the source of varying calibration parameters to the varying token-level sensitivity caused by a precision-dependent outlier migration phenomenon.Motivated by this observation, we propose \\texttt{MoBiQuant}, a novel Mixture-of-Bits quantization framework that adjusts weight precision for elastic LLM inference based on token sensitivity. Specifically, we propose the many-in-one recursive residual quantization that can iteratively reconstruct higher-precision weights and the token-aware router to dynamically select the number of residual bit slices. MoBiQuant enables smooth precision switching while improving generalization for the distribution of token outliers. Experimental results demonstrate that MoBiQuant exhibits strong elasticity, enabling it to match the performance of bit-specific calibrated PTQ on LLaMA3-8B without repeated calibration."}

Humans learn how to use objects by observing and imitating actions, not just by examining shapes. Motivated by this intuition, we introduce video-guided 3D affordance grounding, which leverages dynamic interaction sequences to provide functional supervision. To achieve this, we propose VAGNet, a framework that aligns video-derived interaction cues with 3D structure to resolve ambiguities that static cues cannot address. To support this new setting, we introduce PVAD, the first HOI video-3D pairing affordance dataset, providing functional supervision unavailable in prior works. Extensive experiments on PVAD show that VAGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming static-based baselines. The code and dataset will be open publicly."}

When encountering an unfamiliar KG, such users face a distinct orientation challenge: they do not know what questions are possible, how the knowledge is structured, or how to begin exploration. This paper identifies and theorises this phenomenon as the Initial Exploration Problem (IEP). Drawing on theories from information behaviour and human-computer interaction, including ASK, exploratory search, information foraging, and cognitive load theory, we develop a conceptual framing of the IEP characterised by three interdependent barriers: scope uncertainty, ontology opacity, and query incapacity. We argue that these barriers converge at the moment of first contact, distinguishing the IEP from related concepts that presuppose an existing starting point or information goal. Analysing KG exploration interfaces at the level of interaction primitives, we suggest that many systems rely on epistemic assumptions that do not hold at first contact. This reveals a structural gap in the design space: the absence of interaction primitives for scope revelation, mechanisms that communicate what a KG contains without requiring users to formulate queries or interpret ontological structures. In articulating the IEP, this paper provides a theoretical lens for evaluating KG interfaces and for designing entry-point scaffolding that supports initial exploration."}

Existing methods primarily focus on improving unknown recall, yet overlook interpretability, often leading to known-unknown confusion and reduced prediction reliability. This paper aims to make the entire OWOD framework interpretable, enabling the detector to truly \"knowing the unknown\". To this end, we propose a concept-driven InterPretable OWOD framework(IPOW) by introducing a Concept Decomposition Model (CDM) for OWOD, which explicitly decomposes the coupled RoI features in Faster R-CNN into discriminative, shared, and background concepts. Discriminative concepts identify the most discriminative features to enlarge the distances between known categories, while shared and background concepts, due to their strong generalization ability, can be readily transferred to detect unknown categories. Leveraging the interpretable framework, we identify that known-unknown confusion arises when unknown objects fall into the discriminative space of known classes. To address this, we propose Concept-Guided Rectification (CGR) to further resolve such confusion. Extensive experiments show that IPOW significantly improves unknown recall while mitigating confusion, and provides concept-level interpretability for both known and unknown predictions."}

Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings."}

In response, a common proactive defense leverages fragile watermarks to detect, localize, or even recover manipulated regions. However, these methods always assume an adversary unaware of the embedded watermark, overlooking their inherent vulnerability to watermark removal attacks. Furthermore, this fragility is exacerbated in the commonly used dual-watermark strategy that adds a robust watermark for image ownership verification, where mutual interference and limited embedding capacity reduce the fragile watermark's effectiveness. To address the gap, we propose RecoverMark, a watermarking framework that achieves robust manipulation localization, content recovery, and ownership verification simultaneously. Our key insight is twofold. First, we exploit a critical real-world constraint: an adversary must preserve the background's semantic consistency to avoid visual detection, even if they apply global, imperceptible watermark removal attacks. Second, using the image's own content (face, in this paper) as the watermark enhances extraction robustness. Based on these insights, RecoverMark treats the protected face content itself as the watermark and embeds it into the surrounding background. By designing a robust two-stage training paradigm with carefully crafted distortion layers that simulate comprehensive potential attacks and a progressive training strategy, RecoverMark achieves a robust watermark embedding in no fragile manner for image manipulation localization, recovery, and image IP protection simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed RecoverMark's robustness against both seen and unseen attacks and its generalizability to in-distribution and out-of-distribution data."}

Recent multimodal approaches that integrate ECGs with accompanying clinical reports show strong potential, but they still face two main concerns from a modality perspective: (1) intra-modality: existing models process ECGs in a lead-agnostic manner, overlooking spatial-temporal dependencies across leads, which restricts their effectiveness in modeling fine-grained diagnostic patterns; (2) inter-modality: existing methods directly align ECG signals with clinical reports, introducing modality-specific biases due to the free-text nature of the reports. In light of these two issues, we propose CG-DMER, a contrastive-generative framework for disentangled multimodal ECG representation learning, powered by two key designs: (1) Spatial-temporal masked modeling is designed to better capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and inter-lead spatial dependencies by applying masking across both spatial and temporal dimensions and reconstructing the missing information. (2) A representation disentanglement and alignment strategy is designed to mitigate unnecessary noise and modality-specific biases by introducing modality-specific and modality-shared encoders, ensuring a clearer separation between modality-invariant and modality-specific representations.

More specifically, specific 3D objects are always captured in particular scenes with fixed camera poses, and hence lacks necessary diversity. Such tight entanglement induces the challenging issues of insufficient utilization and overfitting to uniform training data. To mitigate this, we propose an online object-scene-camera decomposition and recomposition data manipulation scheme to more efficiently exploit the training data. We first fully decompose training images into textured 3D object point models and background scenes in an efficient computation and storage manner. We then continuously recompose new training images in each epoch by inserting the 3D objects into the freespace of the background scenes, and rendering them with perturbed camera poses from textured 3D point representation. In this way, the refreshed training data in all epochs can cover the full spectrum of independent object, scene, and camera pose combinations. This scheme can serve as a plug-and-play component to boost M3OD models, working flexibly with both fully and sparsely supervised settings. In the sparsely-supervised setting, objects closest to the ego-camera for all instances are sparsely annotated. We then can flexibly increase the annotated objects to control annotation cost. For validation, our method is widely applied to five representative M3OD models and evaluated on both the KITTI and the more complicated Waymo datasets."}

In this work, we begin by directly comparing how the distribution of information stored across layers of attention heads differs between the protein and natural language domain. Furthermore, we adapt a simple early-exit technique-originally used in the natural language domain to improve efficiency at the cost of performance-to achieve both increased accuracy and substantial efficiency gains in protein non-structural property prediction by allowing the model to automatically select protein representations from the intermediate layers of the PLMs for the specific task and protein at hand. We achieve performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 7.01 percentage points while simultaneously improving efficiency by over 10 percent across models and non-structural prediction tasks.

When composed into a 12-month end-to-end simulation of scientific production, the resulting synthetic corpus is systematically less diverse and less novel than human-authored research from the same period."}

However, its sparse and weak geometric cues make reliable instance activation difficult, limiting the effectiveness of existing radar-camera fusion paradigms. BEV-level fusion offers global scene understanding but suffers from weak instance focus, while perspective-level fusion captures instance details but lacks holistic context. To address these limitations, we propose SIFormer, a scene-instance aware transformer for 3D object detection using 4D radar and camera. SIFormer first suppresses background noise during view transformation through segmentation- and depth-guided localization. It then introduces a cross-view activation mechanism that injects 2D instance cues into BEV space, enabling reliable instance awareness under weak radar geometry. Finally, a transformer-based fusion module aggregates complementary image semantics and radar geometry for robust perception. As a result, with the aim of enhancing instance awareness, SIFormer bridges the gap between the two paradigms, combining their complementary strengths to address inherent sparse nature of radar and improve detection accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that SIFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet and NuScenes datasets. Source code is available at github.com/shawnnnkb/SIFormer."}

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io."}

The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) is a widely used ergonomic risk assessment tool for lifting tasks that relies on six task variables, including horizontal (H) and vertical (V) hand distances; such distances are typically obtained through manual measurement or specialized sensing systems and are difficult to use in real-world environments. We evaluated the feasibility of using innovative vision-language models (VLMs) to non-invasively estimate H and V from RGB video streams. Two multi-stage VLM-based pipelines were developed: a text-guided detection-only pipeline and a detection-plus-segmentation pipeline. Both pipelines used text-guided localization of task-relevant regions of interest, visual feature extraction from those regions, and transformer-based temporal regression to estimate H and V at the start and end of a lift. For a range of lifting tasks, estimation performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out validation across the two pipelines and seven camera view conditions. Results varied significantly across pipelines and camera view conditions, with the segmentation-based, multi-view pipeline consistently yielding the smallest errors, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 6-8 cm when estimating H and 5-8 cm when estimating V. Across pipelines and camera view configurations, pixel-level segmentation reduced estimation error by approximately 20-30% for H and 35-40% for V relative to the detection-only pipeline. These findings support the feasibility of VLM-based pipelines for video-based estimation of RNLE distance parameters."}

However, a key challenge is the noisy nature of such data as it is often collected in production environments. As cleaning noise via manual annotation incurs high costs, this paper proposes a novel method ConceptRM for constructing a high-quality corpus to train a reflection model capable of effectively intercepting false alerts. With only a small amount of expert annotations as anchors, ConceptRM creates perturbed datasets with varying noise ratios and utilizes co-teaching to train multiple distinct models for collaborative learning. By analyzing the consensus decisions of these models, it effectively identifies reliable negative samples from a noisy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptRM significantly enhances the interception of false alerts with minimal annotation cost, outperforming several state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 53.31% on in-domain datasets and 41.67% on out-of-domain datasets."}

In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST.

While 3D generative models have advanced dramatically, models specifically designed to assist human imagination in 3D creation -- particularly for detailing abstractions from coarse to fine -- have not been explored. We propose a framework that enables intuitive and interactive 3D shape generation by iteratively splitting bounding boxes to refine the set of bounding boxes. The main technical components of our framework are two generative models: the box-splitting generative model and the box-to-shape generative model. The first model, named BoxSplitGen, generates a collection of 3D part bounding boxes with varying granularity by iteratively splitting coarse bounding boxes. It utilizes part bounding boxes created through agglomerative merging and learns the reverse of the merging process -- the splitting sequences. The model consists of two main components: the first learns the categorical distribution of the box to be split, and the second learns the distribution of the two new boxes, given the set of boxes and the indication of which box to split. The second model, the box-to-shape generative model, is trained by leveraging the 3D shape priors learned by an existing 3D diffusion model while adapting the model to incorporate bounding box conditioning. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the box-splitting generative model outperforms token prediction models and the inpainting approach with an unconditional diffusion model. Also, we show that our box-to-shape model, based on a state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, provides superior results compared to a previous model."}

We consider the effect of prior exposure to visual images (i.e., visual context) on these judgments for humans and large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that, in contrast to textual context, visual images appear to have little if any impact on human acceptability ratings. However, LLMs display the compression effect seen in previous work on human judgments in document contexts. Different sorts of LLMs are able to predict human acceptability judgments to a high degree of accuracy, but in general, their performance is slightly better when visual contexts are removed. Moreover, the distribution of LLM judgments varies among models, with Qwen resembling human patterns, and others diverging from them. LLM-generated predictions on sentence acceptability are highly correlated with their normalised log probabilities in general. However, the correlations decrease when visual contexts are present, suggesting that a higher gap exists between the internal representations of LLMs and their generated predictions in the presence of visual contexts. Our experimental work suggests interesting points of similarity and of difference between human and LLM processing of sentences in multimodal contexts."}

In this work, we introduce BBQ, a large-scale text-to-image model that directly conditions on numeric bounding boxes and RGB triplets within a unified structured-text framework. We obtain precise spatial and chromatic control by training on captions enriched with parametric annotations, without architectural modifications or inference-time optimization. This also enables intuitive user interfaces such as object dragging and color pickers, replacing ambiguous iterative prompting with precise, familiar controls. Across comprehensive evaluations, BBQ achieves strong box alignment and improves RGB color fidelity over state-of-the-art baselines. More broadly, our results support a new paradigm in which user intent is translated into an intermediate structured language, consumed by a flow-based transformer acting as a renderer and naturally accommodating numeric parameters."}

In MRI studies of brain tumors, however, we often involve multi-parametric scans and substructures. Here, fine-grained modality/parameter-wise reports are usually provided along with global findings and are correlated with different substructures. Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences. Certainty tokens scale penalties; missing cues are down-weighted. On 1238 report-labeled BraTS-MET/MEN scans, our MS-RSuper largely outperforms both a sparsely-supervised baseline and a naive RSuper method."}

MOSFETs are integral components of Power Electronic Building Blocks (PEBBs) and experiences the majority of the thermal load. Effective cooling of MOSFETs is therefore essential to prevent overheating and potential burnout. Determining the required velocity for the purpose of effective cooling is of importance but is an ill-posed inverse problem and difficult to solve using traditional methods. MOSFET consists of multiple layers with different thermal conductivities, including aluminum, pyrolytic graphite sheets (PGS), and stainless steel pipes containing flowing water. We propose an algorithm that employs sequential training of the MOSFET layers in PINNs. Mathematically, the sequential training method decouples the optimization of each layer by treating the parameters of other layers as constants during its training phase. This reduces the dimensionality of the optimization landscape, making it easier to find the global minimum for each layer's parameters and avoid poor local minima. Convergence of the PINNs solution to the analytical solution is theoretically analyzed. Finally we show the prediction of our proposed methodology to be in good agreement with experimental results."}

A key challenge is the train-serving discrepancy: pre-ranking models are trained only on exposed interactions, yet must score all recalled candidates -- including unexposed items -- during online serving. This mismatch not only induces severe sample selection bias but also degrades generalization, especially for long-tail content. Existing debiasing approaches typically rely on heuristics (e.g., negative sampling) or distillation from biased rankers, which either mislabel plausible unexposed items as negatives or propagate exposure bias into pseudo-labels. In this work, we propose Generative Pseudo-Labeling (GPL), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate unbiased, content-aware pseudo-labels for unexposed items, explicitly aligning the training distribution with the online serving space. By offline generating user-specific interest anchors and matching them with candidates in a frozen semantic space, GPL provides high-quality supervision without adding online latency. Deployed in a large-scale production system, GPL improves click-through rate by 3.07%, while significantly enhancing recommendation diversity and long-tail item discovery."}

Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the LLM maps dwelling characteristics to optimal retrofit selections and associated performance outcomes. Evaluation against physics-grounded baselines shows that the model identifies the optimal retrofit for CO2 reduction within its top three recommendations in 98.9% of cases and the shortest discounted payback period in 93.3% of cases. Fine-tuning yields an order-of-magnitude reduction in CO2 prediction error and multi-fold reductions for energy use and retrofit cost.

However, the inherent sparsity of tumors and their morphological diversity lead to obvious heterogeneity across regions, posing significant challenges in aggregating high-quality and discriminative representations. To address this, we introduce a novel concept of anchor instance (AI), a compact subset of instances that are representative within their regions (local) and discriminative at the bag (global) level. These AIs act as semantic references to guide interactions across regions, correcting non-discriminative patterns while preserving regional diversity. Specifically, we propose a dual-level anchor mining (DAM) module to \\textbf{select} AIs from massive instances, where the most informative AI in each region is extracted by assessing its similarity to both local and global embeddings. Furthermore, to ensure completeness and diversity, we devise an anchor-guided region correction (ARC) module that explores the complementary information from all regions to \\textbf{correct} each regional representation. Building upon DAM and ARC, we develop a concise yet effective framework, AINet, which employs a simple predictor and surpasses state-of-the-art methods with substantially fewer FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, both DAM and ARC are modular and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MIL frameworks, consistently improving their performance."}

We evaluated PaperTrail in a within-subjects study with 26 researchers who performed two scholarly editing tasks using PaperTrail and a baseline interface. Our results show that PaperTrail significantly lowered participants' trust compared to the baseline.

However, these methods often struggle to generalize to in-the-wild images, fail to capture real-world correlations between garment parts, and are typically restricted to single-layer outfits. In contrast, we observe that VLMs are effective at describing garments in natural language, yet perform poorly when asked to directly regress GarmentCode parameters from images. To bridge this gap, we propose NGL (Natural Garment Language), a novel intermediate language that restructures GarmentCode into a representation more understandable to language models. Leveraging this language, we introduce NGL-Prompter, a training-free pipeline that queries large VLMs to extract structured garment parameters, which are then deterministically mapped to valid GarmentCode. We evaluate our method on the Dress4D, CloSe and a newly collected dataset of approximately 5,000 in-the-wild fashion images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard geometry metrics and is strongly preferred in both human and GPT-based perceptual evaluations compared to existing baselines.

This paper introduces OpenPort Protocol (OPP), a governance-first specification for exposing application tools through a secure server-side gateway that is model- and runtime-neutral and can bind to existing tool ecosystems. OpenPort defines authorization-dependent discovery, stable response envelopes with machine-actionable \\texttt{agent.*} reason codes, and an authorization model combining integration credentials, scoped permissions, and ABAC-style policy constraints. For write operations, OpenPort specifies a risk-gated lifecycle that defaults to draft creation and human review, supports time-bounded auto-execution under explicit policy, and enforces high-risk safeguards including preflight impact binding and idempotency. To address time-of-check/time-of-use drift in delayed approval flows, OpenPort also specifies an optional State Witness profile that revalidates execution-time preconditions and fails closed on state mismatch. Operationally, the protocol requires admission control (rate limits/quotas) with stable 429 semantics and structured audit events across allow/deny/fail paths so that client recovery and incident analysis are deterministic. We present a reference runtime and an executable governance toolchain (layered conformance profiles, negative security tests, fuzz/abuse regression, and release-gate scans) and evaluate the core profile at a pinned release tag using artifact-based, externally reproducible validation."}

However, recent encoder-based methods, while efficient and tuning-free, often suffer from content leakage, where semantic elements from the style image undesirably appear in the output, impairing prompt fidelity and stylistic consistency. In this work, we introduce CleanStyle, a plug-and-play framework that filters out content-related noise from the style embedding without retraining. Motivated by empirical analysis, we observe that such leakage predominantly stems from the tail components of the style embedding, which are isolated via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To address this, we propose CleanStyleSVD (CS-SVD), which dynamically suppresses tail components using a time-aware exponential schedule, providing clean, style-preserving conditional embeddings throughout the denoising process. Furthermore, we present Style-Specific Classifier-Free Guidance (SS-CFG), which reuses the suppressed tail components to construct style-aware unconditional inputs. Unlike conventional methods that use generic negative embeddings (e.g., zero vectors), SS-CFG introduces targeted negative signals that reflect style-specific but prompt-irrelevant visual elements. This enables the model to effectively suppress these distracting patterns during generation, thereby improving prompt fidelity and enhancing the overall visual quality of stylized outputs. Our approach is lightweight, interpretable, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-based diffusion models without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CleanStyle substantially reduces content leakage, improves stylization quality and improves prompt alignment across a wide range of style references and prompts."}

However, during RL training, the enormous state space of MLLM and sparse rewards often leads to entropy collapse, policy degradation, or over-exploitation of suboptimal behaviors. This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity while avoiding the drawbacks of uncontrolled random sampling, yielding inefficient exploration. In this paper, we propose CalibRL, a hybrid-policy RLVR framework that supports controllable exploration with expert guidance, enabled by two key mechanisms. First, a distribution-aware advantage weighting scales updates by group rareness to calibrate the distribution, therefore preserving exploration. Meanwhile, the asymmetric activation function (LeakyReLU) leverages the expert knowledge as a calibration baseline to moderate overconfident updates while preserving their corrective direction. CalibRL increases policy entropy in a guided manner and clarifies the target distribution by estimating the on-policy distribution through online sampling. Updates are driven by these informative behaviors, avoiding convergence to erroneous patterns. Importantly, these designs help alleviate the distributional mismatch between the model's policy and expert trajectories, thereby achieving a more stable balance between exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrate consistent improvements, validating the effectiveness of our controllable hybrid-policy RLVR training.

We introduce SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates uncertainty directly into the reward design. SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability. Experiments on two benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, show that our method consistently improves success rates over strong baselines.

In this paper, we propose a unified stochastic formulation that bridges Monte Carlo rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling. First, a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) formulation for Monte Carlo integration under the Central Limit Theorem is modeled. Through instantiation via physically based path tracing, we convert it into a physically grounded SDE representation. Moreover, we provide a systematic analysis of how the physical characteristics of path tracing can be extended to existing diffusion models from the perspective of noise variance.

Although widely studied in binary classification, these issues remain underexplored in multi-class settings, where complex inter-class relationships make minority-majority structures unclear and traditional clustering fails to capture distribution shape. Approaches that rely only on geometric distances risk removing informative samples and generating low-quality synthetic data, while binarization approaches treat imbalance locally and ignore global inter-class dependencies. At the algorithmic level, ensembles struggle to integrate weak classifiers, leading to limited robustness. This paper proposes IMOVNO+ (IMbalance-OVerlap-NOise+ Algorithm-Level Optimization), a two-level framework designed to jointly enhance data quality and algorithmic robustness for binary and multi-class tasks. At the data level, first, conditional probability is used to quantify the informativeness of each sample. Second, the dataset is partitioned into core, overlapping, and noisy regions. Third, an overlapping-cleaning algorithm is introduced that combines Z-score metrics with a big-jump gap distance. Fourth, a smart oversampling algorithm based on multi-regularization controls synthetic sample proximity, preventing new overlaps. At the algorithmic level, a meta-heuristic prunes ensemble classifiers to reduce weak-learner influence. IMOVNO+ was evaluated on 35 datasets (13 multi-class, 22 binary). Results show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods, approaching 100% in several cases. For multi-class data, IMOVNO+ achieves gains of 37-57% in G-mean, 25-44% in F1-score, 25-39% in precision, and 26-43% in recall.

Inspired by the incremental and compositional nature of human communication, we introduce COMmunication inspired Tokenization (COMiT), a framework for learning structured discrete visual token sequences. COMiT constructs a latent message within a fixed token budget by iteratively observing localized image crops and recurrently updating its discrete representation. At each step, the model integrates new visual information while refining and reorganizing the existing token sequence. After several encoding iterations, the final message conditions a flow-matching decoder that reconstructs the full image. Both encoding and decoding are implemented within a single transformer model and trained end-to-end using a combination of flow-matching reconstruction and semantic representation alignment losses. Our experiments demonstrate that while semantic alignment provides grounding, attentive sequential tokenization is critical for inducing interpretable, object-centric token structure and substantially improving compositional generalization and relational reasoning over prior methods."}

A pronounced distributional gap between isotropic noise priors and target action distributions, which increases denoising steps and the incidence of infeasible samples. (ii) Poor robustness. Existing policies condition solely on the current observation, neglecting the constraint of history sequence and thus lacking awareness of task progress and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce OptimusVLA, a dual-memory VLA framework with Global Prior Memory (GPM) and Local Consistency Memory (LCM). GPM replaces Gaussian noise with task-level priors retrieved from semantically similar trajectories, thereby shortening the generative path and reducing the umber of function evaluations (NFE). LCM dynamically models executed action sequence to infer task progress and injects a learned consistency constraint that enforces temporal coherence and smoothness of trajectory. Across three simulation benchmarks, OptimusVLA consistently outperforms strong baselines: it achieves 98.6% average success rate on LIBERO, improves over pi_0 by 13.5% on CALVIN, and attains 38% average success rate on RoboTwin 2.0 Hard.

While MRI is essential for accurate diagnosis, its interpretation remains exceptionally challenging. Radiologists must identify multiple potential abnormalities within complex anatomical structures across different imaging planes, a process that requires significant expertise and is prone to variability. We developed OrthoDiffusion, a unified diffusion-based foundation model designed for multi-task musculoskeletal MRI interpretation. The framework utilizes three orientation-specific 3D diffusion models, pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on 15,948 unlabeled knee MRI scans, to learn robust anatomical features from sagittal, coronal, and axial views. These view-specific representations are integrated to support diverse clinical tasks, including anatomical segmentation and multi-label diagnosis. Our evaluation demonstrates that OrthoDiffusion achieves excellent performance in the segmentation of 11 knee structures and the detection of 8 knee abnormalities. The model exhibited remarkable robustness across different clinical centers and MRI field strengths, consistently outperforming traditional supervised models. Notably, in settings where labeled data was scarce, OrthoDiffusion maintained high diagnostic precision using only 10\\% of training labels. Furthermore, the anatomical representations learned from knee imaging proved highly transferable to other joints, achieving strong diagnostic performance across 11 diseases of the ankle and shoulder. These findings suggest that diffusion-based foundation models can serve as a unified platform for multi-disease diagnosis and anatomical segmentation, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of musculoskeletal MRI interpretation in real-world clinical workflows."}

To address this limitation, we explore query-agnostic methods for compressing multi-vector document representations under a constant vector budget. We introduce four approaches for index compression: sequence resizing, memory tokens, hierarchical pooling, and a novel attention-guided clustering (AGC). AGC uses an attention-guided mechanism to identify the most semantically salient regions of a document as cluster centroids and to weight token aggregation. Evaluating these methods on retrieval tasks spanning text (BEIR), visual-document (ViDoRe), and video (MSR-VTT, MultiVENT 2.0), we show that attention-guided clustering consistently outperforms other parameterized compression methods (sequence resizing and memory tokens), provides greater flexibility in index size than non-parametric hierarchical clustering, and achieves competitive or improved performance compared to a full, uncompressed index.

Many existing solutions require paired multimodal data per patient or rely on complex architectures, both of which are impractical in real clinical settings. In this work, we consider a realistic FL scenario where each client holds single-modality data (CT or MRI), and systematically investigate augmentation strategies for cross-modality generalization. Using abdominal organ segmentation and whole-heart segmentation as representative multi-class and binary segmentation benchmarks, we evaluate convolution-based spatial augmentation, frequency-domain manipulation, domain-specific normalization, and global intensity nonlinear (GIN) augmentation. Our results show that GIN consistently outperforms alternatives in both centralized and federated settings by simulating cross-modality appearance variations while preserving anatomical structure.

However, due to the sparse information content in individual events, directly processing the raw event data to solve vision tasks is highly inefficient, which severely limits the applicability of state-of-the-art methods in real-time tasks, such as motion segmentation, a fundamental task for dynamic scene understanding. Incorporating normal flow as an intermediate representation to compress motion information from event clusters within a localized region provides a more effective solution. In this work, we propose a normal flow-based motion segmentation framework for event-based vision. Leveraging the dense normal flow directly learned from event neighborhoods as input, we formulate the motion segmentation task as an energy minimization problem solved via graph cuts, and optimize it iteratively with normal flow clustering and motion model fitting. By using a normal flow-based motion model initialization and fitting method, the proposed system is able to efficiently estimate the motion models of independently moving objects with only a limited number of candidate models, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and ensures real-time performance, achieving nearly a 800x speedup in comparison to the open-source state-of-the-art method.

Using this framework, we create the first open dataset, named SIMSPINE, which provides sparse vertebra-level 3D spinal annotations for natural full-body motions in indoor multi-camera capture without external restraints. With 2.14 million frames, this enables data-driven learning of vertebral kinematics from subtle posture variations and bridges the gap between musculoskeletal simulation and computer vision. In addition, we release pretrained baselines covering fine-tuned 2D detectors, monocular 3D pose lifting models, and multi-view reconstruction pipelines, establishing a unified benchmark for biomechanically valid spine motion estimation. Specifically, our 2D spine baselines improve the state-of-the-art from 0.63 to 0.80 AUC in controlled environments, and from 0.91 to 0.93 AP for in-the-wild spine tracking. Together, the simulation framework and SIMSPINE dataset advance research in vision-based biomechanics, motion analysis, and digital human modeling by enabling reproducible, anatomically grounded 3D spine estimation under natural conditions."}

This process typically involves two stages: identifying the layer to edit and performing the parameter update. Intuitively, different queries may localize knowledge at different depths of the model, resulting in different sample-wise editing performance for a fixed editing layer. In this work, we hypothesize the existence of fixed golden layers that can achieve near-optimal editing performance similar to sample-wise optimal layers. To validate this hypothesis, we provide empirical evidence by comparing golden layers against ground-truth sample-wise optimal layers. Furthermore, we show that golden layers can be reliably identified using a proxy dataset and generalize effectively to unseen test set queries across datasets. Finally, we propose a novel method, namely Layer Gradient Analysis (LGA) that estimates golden layers efficiently via gradient-attribution, avoiding extensive trial-and-error across multiple editing runs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our LGA approach across different LLM types and various knowledge editing methods."}

While some promising approaches attempt to mitigate this by constructing Q&A data for auxiliary training, they still fail to fundamentally equip VLMs with the ability to comprehensively handle diverse evaluation protocols. We thus chart a new course, advocating for the infusion of VLMs with the cross-view geometric grounding of mature 3D foundation models, closing this critical capability gap in autonomous driving. In this spirit, we propose a novel architecture, VGGDrive, which empowers Vision-language models with cross-view Geometric Grounding for autonomous Driving. Concretely, to bridge the cross-view 3D geometric features from the frozen visual 3D model with the VLM's 2D visual features, we introduce a plug-and-play Cross-View 3D Geometric Enabler (CVGE). The CVGE decouples the base VLM architecture and effectively empowers the VLM with 3D features through a hierarchical adaptive injection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that VGGDrive enhances base VLM performance across five autonomous driving benchmarks, including tasks like cross-view risk perception, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. It's our belief that mature 3D foundation models can empower autonomous driving tasks through effective integration, and we hope our initial exploration demonstrates the potential of this paradigm to the autonomous driving community."}

Along this direction, we propose a robust and efficient framework, namely Reweighting Uncertainty in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (RU4D-SLAM) for 4D scene reconstruction, that introduces temporal factors into spatial 3D representation while incorporating uncertainty-aware perception of scene changes, blurred image synthesis, and dynamic scene reconstruction. We enhance dynamic scene representation by integrating motion blur rendering, and improve uncertainty-aware tracking by extending per-pixel uncertainty modeling, which is originally designed for static scenarios, to handle blurred images. Furthermore, we propose a semantic-guided reweighting mechanism for per-pixel uncertainty estimation in dynamic scenes, and introduce a learnable opacity weight to support adaptive 4D mapping. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both trajectory accuracy and 4D scene reconstruction, particularly in dynamic environments with moving objects and low-quality inputs.

To address this gap, we introduce a training-free framework for concept-based image editing, which unifies Optimised DDS with LoRA-driven concept composition, where the training data of the LoRA represent the concept. Our approach enables combining and controlling multiple visual concepts directly within the diffusion process, integrating semantic guidance from text with low-level cues from pretrained concept adapters. We further refine DDS for stability and controllability through ordered timesteps, regularisation, and negative-prompt guidance. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate consistent improvements over existing training-free diffusion editing methods on InstructPix2Pix and ComposLoRA benchmarks.

Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) tackles this challenge by estimating encoder filters (i.e., kernel weights) from user-drawn markers on discriminative regions of a few representative images without traditional optimization. Such an encoder combined with an adaptive decoder comprises a FLIM network fully trained without backpropagation. Prior research has demonstrated their effectiveness in Salient Object Detection (SOD), being significantly lighter than existing lightweight models. This study revisits FLIM SOD and introduces FLIM-Bag of Feature Points (FLIM-BoFP), a considerably faster filter estimation method. The previous approach, FLIM-Cluster, derives filters through patch clustering at each encoder's block, leading to computational overhead and reduced control over filter locations. FLIM-BoFP streamlines this process by performing a single clustering at the input block, creating a bag of feature points, and defining filters directly from mapped feature points across all blocks. The paper evaluates the benefits in efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization of FLIM-BoFP compared to FLIM-Cluster and other state-of-the-art baselines for parasite detection in optical microscopy images."}

Recent vision-language methods incorporate textual semantics generated by large language models, but treat these descriptions as static class-level priors that are shared across all samples and lack sample-wise refinement. This limits both the diversity and precision of visual-semantic alignment, hindering generalization under limited supervision. To overcome this, we propose the stochastic MUlti-view Semantic Enhancement (MUSE), a framework that first refines semantic precision via sample-wise adaptation and then enhances semantic richness through retrieval-augmented multi-view generation. Specifically, MUSE introduces Sample-wise Fine-grained Semantic Enhancement (SFSE), which yields a fine-grained semantic prior for each sample through MoE-based adaptive visual-semantic interaction. Guided by this prior, Stochastic Multi-view Model Optimization (SMMO) constructs an LLM-generated knowledge base of diverse pathological descriptions per class, then retrieves and stochastically integrates multiple matched textual views during training. These dynamically selected texts serve as enriched semantic supervisions to stochastically optimize the vision-language model, promoting robustness and mitigating overfitting. Experiments on three benchmark WSI datasets show that MUSE consistently outperforms existing vision-language baselines in few-shot settings, demonstrating that effective few-shot pathology learning requires not only richer semantic sources but also their active and sample-aware semantic optimization.

However, these approaches fail to capture the complex interplay among different harm categories, leading to \"harmful conflicts\" where mitigating one type of harm may inadvertently amplify another, thus increasing overall harmful rate. To address this issue, we propose Conflict-aware Adaptive Safety Guidance (CASG), a training-free framework that dynamically identifies and applies the category-aligned safety direction during generation. CASG is composed of two components: (i) Conflict-aware Category Identification (CaCI), which identifies the harmful category most aligned with the model's evolving generative state, and (ii) Conflict-resolving Guidance Application (CrGA), which applies safety steering solely along the identified category to avoid multi-category interference. CASG can be applied to both latent-space and text-space safeguards.

The model embeds high-dimensional shipment features with dedicated embedding layers for tabular data, and then uses a classification-then-regression strategy to predict the delivery delay duration for on-time and delayed shipments. Unlike sequential pipelines, this approach enables end-to-end training, improves the detection of delayed cases, and supports probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty-aware decision making. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale real-world dataset from an industrial partner, comprising more than 10 million historical shipment records across four major source locations with distinct regional characteristics. The proposed model is compared with traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.67-0.91 days for delayed-shipment predictions, outperforming single-step tree-based regression baselines by 41-64% and two-step classify-then-regress tree-based models by 15-35%. These gains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in operational delivery delay forecasting under highly imbalanced and heterogeneous conditions."}

Although VLMs have already demonstrated impressive capabilities in common visual question answering and logical reasoning, they still lack the ability to make reasonable decisions in complex real-world environments. We define this ability as spatial logical reasoning, which not only requires understanding the spatial relationships among objects in complex scenes, but also the logical dependencies between steps in multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial Logical Question Answering (SpatiaLQA), a benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial logical reasoning capabilities of VLMs. SpatiaLQA consists of 9,605 question answer pairs derived from 241 real-world indoor scenes. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 mainstream VLMs, and the results show that even the most advanced models still struggle with spatial logical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a method called recursive scene graph assisted reasoning, which leverages visual foundation models to progressively decompose complex scenes into task-relevant scene graphs, thereby enhancing the spatial logical reasoning ability of VLMs, outperforming all previous methods.

As a result, even state-of-the-art generators (e.g., SeedDream4.0, Qwen-Image) still struggle to render structurally faithful text. To address this, we propose TextPecker, a plug-and-play structural anomaly perceptive RL strategy that mitigates noisy reward signals and works with any textto-image generator. To enable this capability, we construct a recognition dataset with character-level structural-anomaly annotations and develop a stroke-editing synthesis engine to expand structural-error coverage. Experiments show that TextPecker consistently improves diverse text-to-image models; even on the well-optimized Qwen-Image, it significantly yields average gains of 4% in structural fidelity and 8.7% in semantic alignment for Chinese text rendering, establishing a new state-of-the-art in high-fidelity VTR. Our work fills a gap in VTR optimization, providing a foundational step towards reliable and structural faithful visual text generation."}

We extract over 671,000 question-answer pairs from 23,000 verified interview transcripts across 1,000 public personalities, each with an average of 11.5 hours of interview content.

We operationalize this insight by constructing a 22-dimension query feature vector covering clause complexity, lexical rarity, and anaphora, negation, answerability, and intention grounding, all known to affect human comprehension. Using 369,837 real-world queries, we ask: Are there certain types of queries that make hallucination more likely? A large-scale analysis reveals a consistent \"risk landscape\": certain features such as deep clause nesting and underspecification align with higher hallucination propensity. In contrast, clear intention grounding and answerability align with lower hallucination rates. Others, including domain specificity, show mixed, dataset- and model-dependent effects. Thus, these findings establish an empirically observable query-feature representation correlated with hallucination risk, paving the way for guided query rewriting and future intervention studies."}

This paper introduces General Intensity Direction (GID), a preprocessing method that improves rotation robustness without modifying the network architecture. The method estimates a global orientation for each image and aligns it to a canonical reference frame, allowing standard models to process inputs more consistently across different rotations. Unlike moment-based approaches that extract invariant descriptors, this method directly transforms the image while preserving spatial structure, making it compatible with convolutional networks. Experimental evaluation on the rotated MNIST dataset shows that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art rotation-invariant architectures. Additional experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, confirm that the method remains effective under more complex conditions."}

Surrogate models can accelerate simulations, but generalization across diverse anatomies is challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. We propose a two-step framework that decouples geometric representation from learning the physics response, to enable shape-informed surrogate modeling under data-scarce conditions. First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds. Overall, our results, obtained on idealized and patient-specific datasets, show that the proposed approaches allow for accurate predictions and generalization to unseen geometries, and robustness to noisy or sparsely sampled inputs."}

However, we identify a neighbor compensation effect in these approaches: dropped Gaussians are often compensated by their neighbors, weakening the intended regularization. Moreover, these methods overlook the contribution of high-degree spherical harmonic coefficients (SH) to overfitting. To address these issues, we propose DropAnSH-GS, a novel anchor-based Dropout strategy. Rather than dropping Gaussians independently, our method randomly selects certain Gaussians as anchors and simultaneously removes their spatial neighbors. This effectively disrupts local redundancies near anchors and encourages the model to learn more robust, globally informed representations. Furthermore, we extend the Dropout to color attributes by randomly dropping higher-degree SH to concentrate appearance information in lower-degree SH. This strategy further mitigates overfitting and enables flexible post-training model compression via SH truncation. Experimental results demonstrate that DropAnSH-GS substantially outperforms existing Dropout methods with negligible computational overhead, and can be readily integrated into various 3DGS variants to enhance their performances.

We present PhysMem, a memory framework that enables VLM robot planners to learn physical principles from interaction at test time, without updating model parameters. The system records experiences, generates candidate hypotheses, and verifies them through targeted interaction before promoting validated knowledge to guide future decisions. A central design choice is verification before application: the system tests hypotheses against new observations rather than applying retrieved experience directly, reducing rigid reliance on prior experience when physical conditions change. We evaluate PhysMem on three real-world manipulation tasks and simulation benchmarks across four VLM backbones. On a controlled brick insertion task, principled abstraction achieves 76% success compared to 23% for direct experience retrieval, and real-world experiments show consistent improvement over 30-minute deployment sessions."}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising potential to automate annotation, their capability to replace human annotators remains underexplored. This paper aims to analyze the gap between MLLM-generated and human annotations and to propose an effective solution that enables MLLM-based annotation to replace manual labeling. Our analysis of MLLM annotations reveals that, under a conservative estimate, MLLMs can reduce annotation cost to as low as one-thousandth of the human cost, mainly accounting for GPU usage, which is nearly negligible compared to manual efforts. Their annotation quality reaches about 50\\% to 80\\% of human performance, while achieving over 90\\% performance on downstream training tasks.Motivated by these findings, we propose TagLLM, a novel framework for image tagging, which aims to narrow the gap between MLLM-generated and human annotations. TagLLM comprises two components: Candidates generation, which employs structured group-wise prompting to efficiently produce a compact candidate set that covers as many true labels as possible while reducing subsequent annotation workload; and label disambiguation, which interactively calibrates the semantic concept of categories in the prompts and effectively refines the candidate labels. Extensive experiments show that TagLLM substantially narrows the gap between MLLM-generated and human annotations, especially in downstream training performance, where it closes about 60\\% to 80\\% of the difference."}

The dearth of studies focusing on hallucinations in closed-source models is especially concerning, as they constitute the vast majority of models in institutional deployments. We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

We introduce Evolving World Object Detection (EWOD), a paradigm coupling incremental learning, domain adaptation, and unknown detection under exemplar-free constraints. To tackle EWOD, we propose EW-DETR framework that augments DETR-based detectors with three synergistic modules: Incremental LoRA Adapters for exemplar-free incremental learning under evolving domains; a Query-Norm Objectness Adapter that decouples objectness-aware features from DETR decoder queries; and Entropy-Aware Unknown Mixing for calibrated unknown detection. This framework generalises across DETR-based detectors, enabling state-of-the-art RF-DETR to operate effectively in evolving-world settings. We also introduce FOGS (Forgetting, Openness, Generalisation Score) to holistically evaluate performance across these dimensions. Extensive experiments on Pascal Series and Diverse Weather benchmarks show EW-DETR outperforms other methods, improving FOGS by 57.24%."}

The framework evaluates each turn using eight operationally grounded metrics that separate retrieval quality, grounding fidelity, answer utility, precision integrity, and case/workflow alignment. A severity-aware scoring protocol reduces score inflation and improves diagnostic clarity across heterogeneous enterprise cases. The system uses deterministic prompting with strict JSON outputs, enabling scalable batch evaluation, regression testing, and production monitoring.\n  Through a comparative study of two instruction-tuned models across short and long workflows, we show that generic proxy metrics provide ambiguous signals, while the proposed framework exposes enterprise-critical tradeoffs that are actionable for system improvement."}

In this work, we present an in-context image decomposition framework that leverages large diffusion foundation models for layered separation. We focus on the challenging case of logo-object decomposition, where the goal is to disentangle a logo from the surface on which it appears while faithfully preserving both layers. Our method fine-tunes a pretrained diffusion model via lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a cycle-consistent tuning strategy that jointly trains decomposition and composition models, enforcing reconstruction consistency between decomposed and recomposed images. This bidirectional supervision substantially enhances robustness in cases where the layers exhibit complex interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive self-improving process, which iteratively augments the training set with high-quality model-generated examples to refine performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves accurate and coherent decompositions and also generalizes effectively across other decomposition types, suggesting its potential as a unified framework for layered image decomposition."}

Although techniques from both paradigms have been shown to improve model accuracy on a wide variety of tasks, we argue that the datasets used for these evaluations could cause overoptimistic evaluation results. Unlike many real-world datasets, they often (1) have no features with more salience than truthfulness, (2) have balanced training sets, and (3) contain only data points to which the model can give a well-defined answer. We construct datasets that lack each of these properties to stress-test a range of standard unsupervised elicitation and easy-to-hard generalization techniques. We find that no technique reliably performs well on any of these challenges. We also study ensembling and combining easy-to-hard and unsupervised techniques, and find they only partially mitigate performance degradation due to these challenges.

However, this capability also introduces a previously overlooked risk: adversaries may exploit visual instructions to inject malicious intent through the image modality. In this work, we uncover this risk by proposing Visual Instruction Injection (VII), a training-free and transferable jailbreaking framework that intentionally disguises the malicious intent of unsafe text prompts as benign visual instructions in the safe reference image. Specifically, VII coordinates a Malicious Intent Reprogramming module to distill malicious intent from unsafe text prompts while minimizing their static harmfulness, and a Visual Instruction Grounding module to ground the distilled intent onto a safe input image by rendering visual instructions that preserve semantic consistency with the original unsafe text prompt, thereby inducing harmful content during I2V generation. Empirically, our extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art commercial I2V models (Kling-v2.5-turbo, Gemini Veo-3.1, Seedance-1.5-pro, and PixVerse-V5) demonstrate that VII achieves Attack Success Rates of up to 83.5% while reducing Refusal Rates to near zero, significantly outperforming existing baselines."}

Drawing on cognitive psychology, we identify (both theoretically and empirically) two mechanisms undermining LLM idea diversity. First, at the individual level, LLMs exhibit fixation just as humans do, where early outputs constrain subsequent ideation. Second, at the collective level, LLMs aggregate knowledge into a unified distribution rather than exhibiting the knowledge partitioning inherent to human populations, where each person occupies a distinct region of the knowledge space. Through four studies, we demonstrate that targeted prompting interventions can address each mechanism independently: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reduces fixation by encouraging structured reasoning (only in LLMs, not humans), while ordinary personas (versus \"creative entrepreneurs\" such as Steve Jobs) improve knowledge partitioning by serving as diverse sampling cues, anchoring generation in distinct regions of the semantic space. Combining both approaches produces the highest idea diversity, outperforming humans. These findings offer a theoretically grounded framework for understanding LLM idea diversity and practical strategies for human-AI collaborations that leverage AI's efficiency without compromising the diversity essential to a healthy innovation ecosystem."}

However, EHRs are often sparse and contain missing data due to various challenges and limitations in data collection and sharing between healthcare providers. Existing techniques for imputing missing values predominantly focus on known unknowns, such as missing or unavailable values of lab test results; most do not explicitly address situations where it is difficult to distinguish what is missing. For instance, a missing diagnosis code in an EHR could signify either that the patient has not been diagnosed with the condition or that a diagnosis was made, but not shared by a provider. Such situations fall into the paradigm of unknown unknowns. To address this challenge, we develop a general purpose algorithm for denoising data to recover unknown missing values in binary EHRs. We design a transformer-based denoising neural network where the output is thresholded adaptively to recover values in cases where we predict data are missing. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in denoising medical codes within a real EHR dataset compared to existing imputation approaches and leads to increased performance on downstream tasks using the denoised data. In particular, when applying our method to a real world application, predicting hospital readmission from EHRs, our method achieves statistically significant improvement over all existing baselines."}

To address this gap, we introduce the Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions (CHAIN) benchmark, an interactive 3D, physics-driven testbed designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and 3D stacking and packing. We conduct a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings.

In this work, we begin by directly comparing how the distribution of information stored across layers of attention heads differs between the protein and natural language domain. Furthermore, we adapt a simple early-exit technique-originally used in the natural language domain to improve efficiency at the cost of performance-to achieve both increased accuracy and substantial efficiency gains in protein non-structural property prediction by allowing the model to automatically select protein representations from the intermediate layers of the PLMs for the specific task and protein at hand. We achieve performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 7.01 percentage points while simultaneously improving efficiency by over 10 percent across models and non-structural prediction tasks. Our work opens up an area of research directly comparing how language models change behavior when moved into the protein domain and advances language modeling in biological domains."}

Pruning techniques affirmed themselves as valid tools to extract sparse representations of neural networks parameters, carefully balancing between compression and preservation of information. However, a fundamental assumption behind pruning is that expendable weights should have small impact on the error of the network, while highly important weights should tend to have a larger influence on the inference. We argue that this idea could be generalized; what if a weight is not simply removed but also compensated with a perturbation of the adjacent bias, which does not contribute to the network sparsity? Our work introduces a novel pruning method in which the importance measure of each weight is computed considering the output behavior after an optimal perturbation of its adjacent bias, efficiently computable by automatic differentiation. These perturbations can be then applied directly after the removal of each weight, independently of each other. After deriving analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities, numerical experiments are conducted to benchmark this technique against some of the most popular pruning strategies, demonstrating an intrinsic efficiency of the proposed approach in very diverse machine learning scenarios. Finally, our findings are discussed and the theoretical implications of our results are presented."}

We propose VAUQ, a vision-aware uncertainty quantification framework for LVLM self-evaluation that explicitly measures how strongly a model's output depends on visual evidence. VAUQ introduces the Image-Information Score (IS), which captures the reduction in predictive uncertainty attributable to visual input, and an unsupervised core-region masking strategy that amplifies the influence of salient regions. Combining predictive entropy with this core-masked IS yields a training-free scoring function that reliably reflects answer correctness.

The key to achieving this goal is being able to recognize zone occupancy in real time, without impeding occupants' activities or compromising privacy. While low-resolution, privacy-preserving time-of-flight (ToF) sensor networks have demonstrated good performance in zone counting, the performance depends on careful sensor placement. To address this issue, we propose an automatic sensor placement method that determines optimal sensor layouts for a given number of sensors, and can predict the counting accuracy of such a layout. In particular, given the geometric constraints of an office environment, we simulate a large number of occupant trajectories. We then formulate the sensor placement problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem and solve it with the branch and bound method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method based on simulations of several different office environments."}

Traditional photogrammetry achieves exceptional detail but requires extensive camera arrays (25-200+ views), substantial computation, and manual cleanup in challenging areas like facial hair. Recent alternatives present a fundamental trade-off: foundation models enable efficient single-image reconstruction but lack fine geometric detail, while optimization-based methods achieve higher fidelity but require dense views and expensive computation. We bridge this gap with a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method introduces a multi-view surface normal prediction model that extends monocular foundation models with cross-view attention to produce geometrically consistent normals in a feed-forward pass. We then leverage these predictions as strong geometric priors within an inverse rendering optimization framework to recover high-frequency surface details.

(1) Our first contribution shows that exact maximin share (MMS) allocations are guaranteed to exist whenever goods are allowed to be cost-sensitively shared among at least half of the agents and the number of agents is even; for odd numbers of agents, we obtain a slightly weaker MMS guarantee. (2) We further design a Shared Bag-Filling Algorithm that guarantees a $(1 - C)(k - 1)$-approximate MMS allocation, where $C$ is the maximum cost of sharing a good. Notably, when $(1 - C)(k - 1) \\geq 1$, our algorithm recovers an exact MMS allocation.

This paper introduces Urban Dynamics VideoQA, a benchmark dataset that captures the unscripted real-world behavior of dynamic urban scenes. UDVideoQA is curated from 16 hours of traffic footage recorded at multiple city intersections under diverse traffic, weather, and lighting conditions. It employs an event-driven dynamic blur technique to ensure privacy preservation without compromising scene fidelity. Using a unified annotation pipeline, the dataset contains 28K question-answer pairs generated across 8 hours of densely annotated video, averaging one question per second. Its taxonomy follows a hierarchical reasoning level, spanning basic understanding and attribution to event reasoning, reverse reasoning, and counterfactual inference, enabling systematic evaluation of both visual grounding and causal reasoning. Comprehensive experiments benchmark 10 SOTA VideoLMs on UDVideoQA and 8 models on a complementary video question generation benchmark. Results reveal a persistent perception-reasoning gap, showing models that excel in abstract inference often fail with fundamental visual grounding.

Technology Acceptance in Conversational AI", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.AI", "cs.CY", "cs.ET"], "comment": null, "summary": "Conversational AI tools have been rapidly adopted by students and are becoming part of their learning routines. To understand what drives this adoption, we draw on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and examine how perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use relate to students' behavioral intention to use conversational AI that generates responses for learning tasks. We extend TAM by incorporating trust, perceived enjoyment, and subjective norms as additional factors that capture social and affective influences and uncertainty around AI outputs.\n  Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we find perceived usefulness remains the strongest predictor of students' intention to use conversational AI. However, perceived ease of use does not exert a significant direct effect on behavioral intention once other factors are considered, operating instead indirectly through perceived usefulness. Trust and subjective norms significantly influence perceptions of usefulness, while perceived enjoyment exerts both a direct and indirect effect on usage intentions. These findings suggest that adoption decisions for conversational AI systems are influenced less by effort-related considerations and more by confidence in system outputs, affective engagement, and social context. Future research is needed to further examine how these acceptance relationships generalize across different conversational systems and usage contexts."}

On a manually curated set of 483 instances of PI, we measure memorization: finding that 13.6% are parroted verbatim by the Pythia-6.9b model, i.e., when the model is prompted with the tokens that precede the PI in the original document, greedy decoding generates the entire PI span exactly. We expand this analysis to study models of varying sizes (160M-6.9B) and pretraining time steps (70k-143k iterations) in the Pythia model suite and find that both model size and amount of pretraining are positively correlated with memorization. Even the smallest model, Pythia-160m, parrots 2.7% of the instances exactly.

When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis.

We propose OptiLeak, a reinforcement learning-enhanced framework that maximizes prompt reconstruction efficiency through two-stage fine-tuning. Our key insight is that domain-specific ``hard tokens'' -- terms difficult to predict yet carrying sensitive information -- can be automatically identified via likelihood ranking and used to construct preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization, eliminating manual annotation. This enables effective preference alignment while avoiding the overfitting issues of extended supervised fine-tuning. Evaluated on three benchmarks spanning medical and financial domains, OptiLeak achieves up to $12.48\\times$ reduction in average requests per token compared to baseline approaches, with consistent improvements across model scales from 3B to 14B parameters.

Creating animation-ready meshes is traditionally a tedious manual process requiring artists to carefully place vertices along visual boundaries, a task that typically takes 15-60 minutes per sprite. Our method addresses this through a hybrid learned-algorithmic approach. A segmentation network (EfficientNet-B0 encoder with U-Net decoder) trained on over 100,000 sprite-mask pairs from 172 games achieves an IoU of 0.87, providing accurate binary masks from arbitrary input images. From these masks, we extract exterior contour vertices using Douglas-Peucker simplification with adaptive arc subdivision, and interior vertices along visual boundaries detected via bilateral-filtered multi-channel Canny edge detection with contour-following placement. Delaunay triangulation with mask-based centroid filtering produces the final mesh. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that direct vertex position prediction via neural network heatmap regression is fundamentally not viable for this task: the heatmap decoder consistently fails to converge (loss plateau at 0.061) while the segmentation decoder trains normally under identical conditions. We attribute this to the inherently artistic nature of vertex placement - the same sprite can be meshed validly in many different ways. This negative result validates our hybrid design: learned segmentation where ground truth is unambiguous, algorithmic placement where domain heuristics are appropriate. The complete pipeline processes a sprite in under 3 seconds, representing a speedup of 300x-1200x over manual creation. We release our trained model to the game development community."}

Such queries are typically only one or two words long, rendering them semantically ambiguous, prone to collisions across diverse visual interpretations, and lacking explicit control over the quality of retrieved images. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm of quality-controllable retrieval, which enriches short queries with contextual details while incorporating explicit notions of image quality. Our key idea is to leverage a generative language model as a query completion function, extending underspecified queries into descriptive forms that capture fine-grained visual attributes such as pose, scene, and aesthetics. We introduce a general framework that conditions query completion on discretized quality levels, derived from relevance and aesthetic scoring models, so that query enrichment is not only semantically meaningful but also quality-aware. The resulting system provides three key advantages: 1) flexibility, it is compatible with any pretrained vision-language model (VLMs) without modification; 2) transparency, enriched queries are explicitly interpretable by users; and 3) controllability, enabling retrieval results to be steered toward user-preferred quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves retrieval results and provides effective quality control, bridging the gap between the expressive capacity of modern VLMs and the underspecified nature of short user queries.

This research introduces a transformative framework for generating large-scale urban mobility trajectories, employing a novel application of a transformer-based model pre-trained and fine-tuned through a two-phase process. Initially, trajectory generation is conceptualized as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, with a significant reduction in vocabulary space achieved during tokenization. The integration of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) allows for the capture of trajectory-wise reward signals, leveraging historical data to infer individual mobility preferences. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using the constructed reward model, effectively addressing the challenges inherent in traditional RL-based autoregressive methods, such as long-term credit assignment and handling of sparse reward environments. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that our framework markedly surpasses existing models in terms of reliability and diversity. Our findings not only advance the field of urban mobility modeling but also provide a robust methodology for simulating urban data, with significant implications for traffic management and urban development planning.

However, their clinical adoption has been hindered by a major requirement: training datasets with manually annotated landmarks that maintain point-to-point correspondences across patients rarely exist in practice. We introduce Mask-HybridGNet, a framework that trains graph-based models directly using standard pixel-wise masks, eliminating the need for manual landmark annotations. Our approach aligns variable-length ground truth boundaries with fixed-length landmark predictions by combining Chamfer distance supervision and edge-based regularization to ensure local smoothness and regular landmark distribution, further refined via differentiable rasterization. A significant emergent property of this framework is that predicted landmark positions become consistently associated with specific anatomical locations across patients without explicit correspondence supervision. This implicit atlas learning enables temporal tracking, cross-slice reconstruction, and morphological population analyses. Beyond direct segmentation, Mask-HybridGNet can extract correspondences from existing segmentation masks, allowing it to generate stable anatomical atlases from any high-quality pixel-based model. Experiments across chest radiography, cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, and fetal imaging demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art pixel-based methods, while ensuring anatomical plausibility by enforcing boundary connectivity through a fixed graph adjacency matrix. This framework leverages the vast availability of standard segmentation masks to build structured models that maintain topological integrity and provide implicit correspondences."}

DCQ achieves this by enforcing consistent palette representations across similar images, selectively retaining semantically important colors guided by model perception, and maintaining structural details necessary for effective feature learning. Extensive experiments across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that DCQ significantly improves training performance under aggressive compression, offering a scalable and robust solution for dataset-level storage reduction.

Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods.

The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) is a widely used ergonomic risk assessment tool for lifting tasks that relies on six task variables, including horizontal (H) and vertical (V) hand distances; such distances are typically obtained through manual measurement or specialized sensing systems and are difficult to use in real-world environments. We evaluated the feasibility of using innovative vision-language models (VLMs) to non-invasively estimate H and V from RGB video streams. Two multi-stage VLM-based pipelines were developed: a text-guided detection-only pipeline and a detection-plus-segmentation pipeline. Both pipelines used text-guided localization of task-relevant regions of interest, visual feature extraction from those regions, and transformer-based temporal regression to estimate H and V at the start and end of a lift. For a range of lifting tasks, estimation performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out validation across the two pipelines and seven camera view conditions. Results varied significantly across pipelines and camera view conditions, with the segmentation-based, multi-view pipeline consistently yielding the smallest errors, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 6-8 cm when estimating H and 5-8 cm when estimating V. Across pipelines and camera view configurations, pixel-level segmentation reduced estimation error by approximately 20-30% for H and 35-40% for V relative to the detection-only pipeline. These findings support the feasibility of VLM-based pipelines for video-based estimation of RNLE distance parameters."}

In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control. HVG achieves this through three key designs: (i) Articulated Pose Modulation, which captures the anatomical relationships of 3D joints via a novel dual-dimensional bone map and resolves self-occlusions across views by introducing 3D information; (ii) View and Temporal Alignment, which ensures multi-view consistency and alignment between a reference image and pose sequences for frame-to-frame stability; and (iii) Progressive Spatio-Temporal Sampling with temporal alignment to maintain smooth transitions in long multi-view animations.

Building on this insight, we propose CAMEL, a confidence-gated reflection framework that performs a lightweight single-token preference decision first and selectively invokes reflection only for low-confidence instances. To induce effective self-correction, we train the model via reinforcement learning with counterfactual prefix augmentation, which exposes the model to diverse initial verdicts and encourages genuine revision.

Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is central to scientific imaging, as it enables isolation and quantitative analysis of specific structural features within complex datasets. In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis. This limitation is especially apparent for continuous and geometrically complex structures such as membranes, which are segmented as single entities. Here, we developed TomoROIS-SurfORA, a two step framework for direct, shape-agnostic ROI segmentation and morphological surface analysis. TomoROIS performs deep learning-based ROI segmentation and can be trained from scratch using small annotated datasets, enabling practical application across diverse imaging data. SurfORA processes segmented structures as point clouds and surface meshes to extract quantitative morphological features, including inter-membrane distances, curvature, and surface roughness. It supports both closed and open surfaces, with specific considerations for open surfaces, which are common in cryo-ET due to the missing wedge effect. We demonstrate both tools using in vitro reconstituted membrane systems containing deformable vesicles with complex geometries, enabling automatic quantitative analysis of membrane contact sites and remodeling events such as invagination. While demonstrated here on cryo-ET membrane data, the combined approach is applicable to ROI detection and surface analysis in broader scientific imaging contexts."}

In our prior work PRECTR, we proposed a unified framework to integrate these two subtasks,thereby eliminating their inconsistency and leading to mutual benefit.However, our previous work still faces three main challenges. First, low-active users and new users have limited search behavioral data, making it difficult to achieve effective personalized relevance preference modeling. Second, training data for ranking models predominantly come from high-relevance exposures, creating a distribution mismatch with the broader candidate space in coarse-ranking, leading to generalization bias. Third, due to the latency constraint, the original model employs an Emb+MLP architecture with a frozen BERT encoder, which prevents joint optimization and creates misalignment between representation learning and CTR fine-tuning. To solve these issues, we further reinforce our method and propose PRECTR-V2. Specifically, we mitigate the low-activity users' sparse behavior problem by mining global relevance preferences under the specific query, which facilitates effective personalized relevance modeling for cold-start scenarios. Subsequently, we construct hard negative samples through embedding noise injection and relevance label reconstruction, and optimize their relative ranking against positive samples via pairwise loss, thereby correcting exposure bias. Finally, we pretrain a lightweight transformer-based encoder via knowledge distillation from LLM and SFT on the text relevance classification task. This encoder replaces the frozen BERT module, enabling better adaptation to CTR fine-tuning and advancing beyond the traditional Emb+MLP paradigm."}

A pronounced distributional gap between isotropic noise priors and target action distributions, which increases denoising steps and the incidence of infeasible samples. (ii) Poor robustness.

While AI for Science has witnessed the transformative power of foundation models in disciplines like genomics and meteorology, urban computing remains fragmented due to \"scenario-specific\" models, which are overfitted to specific regions or tasks, hindering their generalizability. To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations. Finally, addressing dynamics via architecture scaling, we propose UrbanFM, a minimalist self-attention architecture designed with limited inductive biases to autonomously learn dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from massive data. Furthermore, we establish EvalST, the largest-scale urban spatio-temporal benchmark to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrbanFM achieves remarkable zero-shot generalization across unseen cities and tasks, marking a pivotal first step toward large-scale urban spatio-temporal foundation models."}

To address this limitation, we introduce UniLACT, a transformer-based VLA model that incorporates geometric structure through depth-aware latent pretraining, enabling downstream policies to inherit stronger spatial priors. To facilitate this process, we propose UniLARN, a unified latent action learning framework based on inverse and forward dynamics objectives that learns a shared embedding space for RGB and depth while explicitly modeling their cross-modal interactions. This formulation produces modality-specific and unified latent action representations that serve as pseudo-labels for the depth-aware pretraining of UniLACT.

We study the applicability of unsupervised probabilistic methods to efficiently identify rare events in multidimensional solar observations and optimize our computational resources to the study of these extreme phenomena. We introduce Inspectorch, an open-source framework that utilizes flow-based models: flexible density estimators capable of learning the multidimensional distribution of solar observations. Once optimized, it assigns a probability to each sample, allowing us to identify unusual events. We apply this approach by applying it to observations from the Hinode Spectro-Polarimeter, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager at Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter. We find that the algorithm assigns consistently lower probabilities to spectra that exhibit unusual features. For example, it identifies profiles with very strong Doppler shifts, uncommon broadening, and temporal dynamics associated with small-scale reconnection events, among others. As a result, Inspectorch demonstrates that density estimation using flow-based models offers a powerful approach to identifying rare events in large solar datasets. The resulting probabilistic anomaly scores allow computational resources to be focused on the most informative and physically relevant events.

Inspired by the incremental and compositional nature of human communication, we introduce COMmunication inspired Tokenization (COMiT), a framework for learning structured discrete visual token sequences. COMiT constructs a latent message within a fixed token budget by iteratively observing localized image crops and recurrently updating its discrete representation. At each step, the model integrates new visual information while refining and reorganizing the existing token sequence. After several encoding iterations, the final message conditions a flow-matching decoder that reconstructs the full image. Both encoding and decoding are implemented within a single transformer model and trained end-to-end using a combination of flow-matching reconstruction and semantic representation alignment losses. Our experiments demonstrate that while semantic alignment provides grounding, attentive sequential tokenization is critical for inducing interpretable, object-centric token structure and substantially improving compositional generalization and relational reasoning over prior methods."}

This paper introduces a progressive pipeline integrating DEFOM-Stereo foundation-model disparity estimation, SAM3 instance segmentation, and multi-stage depth optimization to deliver robust per-branch point clouds. Starting from a naive baseline, we systematically identify and resolve three error families through successive refinements. Mask boundary contamination is first addressed through morphological erosion and subsequently refined via a skeleton-preserving variant to safeguard thin-branch topology. Segmentation inaccuracy is then mitigated using LAB-space Mahalanobis color validation coupled with cross-branch overlap arbitration. Finally, depth noise - the most persistent error source - is initially reduced by outlier removal and median filtering, before being superseded by a robust five-stage scheme comprising MAD global detection, spatial density consensus, local MAD filtering, RGB-guided filtering, and adaptive bilateral filtering. Evaluated on 1920x1080 stereo imagery of Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) acquired with a ZED Mini camera (63 mm baseline) from a UAV in Canterbury, New Zealand, the proposed pipeline reduces the average per-branch depth standard deviation by 82% while retaining edge fidelity. The result is geometrically coherent 3D point clouds suitable for autonomous pruning tool positioning. All code and processed data are publicly released to facilitate further UAV forestry research."}

In Bayesian inverse problems, this could be achieved by evaluating the model evidence $p(y \\mid M)$ under different models $M$ that specify the prior and then selecting the one with the highest value. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art approach to solving inverse problems with a data-driven prior; however, directly computing the model evidence with respect to a diffusion prior is intractable. Furthermore, most existing model evidence estimators require either many pointwise evaluations of the unnormalized prior density or an accurate clean prior score. We propose \\method, an estimator of the model evidence of a diffusion prior by integrating over the time-marginals of posterior sampling methods. Our method leverages the large amount of intermediate samples naturally obtained during the reverse diffusion sampling process to obtain an accurate estimation of the model evidence using only a handful of posterior samples (e.g., 20). We also demonstrate how to implement our estimator in tandem with recent diffusion posterior sampling methods. Empirically, our estimator matches the model evidence when it can be computed analytically, and it is able to both select the correct diffusion model prior and diagnose prior misfit under different highly ill-conditioned, non-linear inverse problems, including a real-world black hole imaging problem."}

A maqam singer receives training in a traditional face-to-face or through self-training. Automatic Singing Assessment (ASA) uses machine learning (ML) to provide the accuracy of singing styles and can help learners to improve their performance through error detection. Currently, the available ASA tools follow Western music rules. The musical composition requires all notes to stay within their expected pitch range from start to finish. The system fails to detect micro-intervals and pitch bends, so it identifies Kurdish maqam singing as incorrect even though the singer performs according to traditional rules. Kurdish maqam requires recognizing performance errors within microtonal spaces, which is beyond Western equal temperament. This research is the first attempt to address the mentioned gap. While many error types happen during singing, our focus is on pitch, rhythm, and modal stability errors in the context of Bayati-Kurd. We collected 50 songs from 13 vocalists ( 2-3 hours) and annotated 221 error spans (150 fine pitch, 46 rhythm, 25 modal drift). The data was segmented into 15,199 overlapping windows and converted to log-mel spectrograms. We developed a two-headed CNN-BiLSTM with attention mode to decide whether a window contains an error and to classify it based on the chosen errors. Trained for 20 epochs with early stopping at epoch 10, the model reached a validation macro-F1 of 0.468. On the full 50-song evaluation at a 0.750 threshold, recall was 39.4% and precision 25.8% . Within detected windows, type macro-F1 was 0.387, with F1 of 0.492 (fine pitch), 0.536 (rhythm), and 0.133 (modal drift); modal drift recall was 8.0%.

However, the substantial increase in visual tokens, particularly from multi-view inputs, poses serious challenges to real-time robotic manipulation. Existing acceleration techniques for VLMs, such as token pruning, often result in degraded performance when directly applied to VLA models, as they overlook the relationships between different views and fail to account for the dynamic and task-specific characteristics of robotic operation. To address this, we propose BFA++, a dynamic token pruning framework designed specifically for VLA models. BFA++ introduces a hierarchical pruning strategy guided by two-level importance predictors: an intra-view predictor highlights task-relevant regions within each image to suppress spatial noise, while an inter-view predictor identifies critical camera views throughout different manipulation phases to reduce cross-view redundancy. This design enables efficient token selection while preserving essential visual cues, resulting in improved computational efficiency and higher manipulation success rates. Evaluations on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that BFA++ consistently outperforms existing methods. BFA++ improves the success rate by about 10% on both the π0 and RDT models, achieving speedup of 1.8X and 1.5X, respectively. Our results highlight that context-sensitive and task-aware token pruning serves as a more effective strategy than full visual processing, enabling faster inference and improved manipulation accuracy in real-world robotic systems."}

We present SibylSense, an inference-time learning approach that adapts a frozen rubric generator through a tunable memory bank of validated rubric items. Memory is updated via verifier-based item rewards measured by reference-candidate answer discriminative gaps from a handful of examples.

While MRI is essential for accurate diagnosis, its interpretation remains exceptionally challenging. Radiologists must identify multiple potential abnormalities within complex anatomical structures across different imaging planes, a process that requires significant expertise and is prone to variability. We developed OrthoDiffusion, a unified diffusion-based foundation model designed for multi-task musculoskeletal MRI interpretation. The framework utilizes three orientation-specific 3D diffusion models, pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on 15,948 unlabeled knee MRI scans, to learn robust anatomical features from sagittal, coronal, and axial views. These view-specific representations are integrated to support diverse clinical tasks, including anatomical segmentation and multi-label diagnosis. Our evaluation demonstrates that OrthoDiffusion achieves excellent performance in the segmentation of 11 knee structures and the detection of 8 knee abnormalities. The model exhibited remarkable robustness across different clinical centers and MRI field strengths, consistently outperforming traditional supervised models. Notably, in settings where labeled data was scarce, OrthoDiffusion maintained high diagnostic precision using only 10\\% of training labels. Furthermore, the anatomical representations learned from knee imaging proved highly transferable to other joints, achieving strong diagnostic performance across 11 diseases of the ankle and shoulder. These findings suggest that diffusion-based foundation models can serve as a unified platform for multi-disease diagnosis and anatomical segmentation, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of musculoskeletal MRI interpretation in real-world clinical workflows."}

To this end, we propose the Semantic-guided Adaptive Expert Forest (SAEF), a new method that organizes adapters into a structured hierarchy for better knowledge sharing. SAEF first groups tasks into conceptual clusters based on their semantic relationships. Then, within each cluster, it builds a balanced expert tree by creating new adapters from merging the adapters of similar tasks. At inference time, SAEF finds and activates a set of relevant experts from the forest for any given input. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of these activated experts, weighted by how confident each expert is. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SAEF achieves SOTA performance."}

In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions. Across 9x9 Go, 10x10 Othello, and 11x11 Hex, RGSC outperforms AlphaZero and Go-Exploit by an average of 77 and 89 Elo, respectively.

Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible'').

To this end, we propose a proxy-guided framework called ProxyFL that focuses on simultaneously mitigating external and internal heterogeneity via a unified proxy. I.e., we consider the learnable weights of classifier as proxy to simulate the category distribution both locally and globally. For external, we explicitly optimize global proxy against outliers instead of direct weights; for internal, we re-include the discarded samples into training by a positive-negative proxy pool to mitigate the impact of potentially-incorrect pseudo-labels. Insight experiments & theoretical analysis show our significant performance and convergence in FSSL."}

As AI decouples cognition from biology, the marginal cost of measurable execution falls to zero, absorbing any labor capturable by metrics--including creative, analytical, and innovative work. The binding constraint on growth is no longer intelligence but human verification bandwidth: the capacity to validate, audit, and underwrite responsibility when execution is abundant. We model the AGI transition as the collision of two racing cost curves: an exponentially decaying Cost to Automate and a biologically bottlenecked Cost to Verify. This structural asymmetry widens a Measurability Gap between what agents can execute and what humans can afford to verify. It also drives a shift from skill-biased to measurability-biased technical change. Rents migrate to verification-grade ground truth, cryptographic provenance, and liability underwriting--the ability to insure outcomes rather than merely generate them. The current human-in-the-loop equilibrium is unstable: eroded from below as apprenticeship collapses (Missing Junior Loop) and from within as experts codify their obsolescence (Codifier's Curse). Unverified deployment becomes privately rational--a Trojan Horse externality. Unmanaged, these forces pull toward a Hollow Economy. Yet by scaling verification alongside agentic capabilities, the forces that threaten collapse become the catalyst for unbounded discovery and experimentation--an Augmented Economy. We derive a practical playbook for individuals, companies, investors, and policymakers. Today's defining challenge is not the race to deploy the most autonomous systems; it is the race to secure the foundations of their oversight. Only by scaling our bandwidth for verification alongside our capacity for execution can we ensure that the intelligence we have summoned preserves the humanity that initiated it."}

A key safety requirement for UAV following is the accurate estimation of the distance between camera and target object under real-world conditions, achieved by fusing multiple image modalities. UAVs with deep learning-based vision systems offer a new approach to the planning and execution of SAR operations. As part of the system for automatic people detection and face recognition using deep learning, in this paper we present the fusion of depth camera measurements and monocular camera-to-body distance estimation for robust tracking and following. Deep learning-based filtering of depth camera data and estimation of camera-to-body distance from a monocular camera are achieved with YOLO-pose, enabling real-time fusion of depth information using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm. The proposed subsystem, designed for use in drones, estimates and measures the distance between the depth camera and the human body keypoints, to maintain the safe distance between the drone and the human target. Our system provides an accurate estimated distance, which has been validated against motion capture ground truth data.

To address this limitation, we explore query-agnostic methods for compressing multi-vector document representations under a constant vector budget. We introduce four approaches for index compression: sequence resizing, memory tokens, hierarchical pooling, and a novel attention-guided clustering (AGC). AGC uses an attention-guided mechanism to identify the most semantically salient regions of a document as cluster centroids and to weight token aggregation. Evaluating these methods on retrieval tasks spanning text (BEIR), visual-document (ViDoRe), and video (MSR-VTT, MultiVENT 2.0), we show that attention-guided clustering consistently outperforms other parameterized compression methods (sequence resizing and memory tokens), provides greater flexibility in index size than non-parametric hierarchical clustering, and achieves competitive or improved performance compared to a full, uncompressed index.

The law of robustness states that overparameterization is necessary for models to interpolate robustly; in particular, robust interpolation requires the learned function to be Lipschitz. Robust generalization asks whether small robust training loss implies small robust test loss. We resolve this problem by explicitly connecting the two for arbitrary data distributions. Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the $Ω(n^{1/d})$ regime of Wu et al.\\ (2023) and show that, up to constants, robust generalization does not change the order of the Lipschitz constant required for smooth interpolation. We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke (2021) or Wu et al.\\ (2023). For MNIST, we find that the lower-bound Lipschitz constant scales on the order predicted by Wu et al.\\ (2023). Informally, to obtain low robust generalization error, the Lipschitz constant must lie in a range that we bound, and the allowable perturbation radius is linked to the Lipschitz scale."}

Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity."}

Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences.

To address these limitations, we introduce a kernelized self-attention mechanism, where a learnable positional kernel operates purely in the position space, disentangled from semantic similarity, and directly modulates attention weights. When applied per attention block, this kernel enables adaptive multi-scale sequential modeling. Experiments on standard next-item prediction benchmarks show that our positional kernel attention consistently improves over strong competing baselines."}

The proposed dual MHSA (DMHSA) models evaluate the SINR of a scheduled user group without requiring explicit MMSE calculations. The architecture achieves a computational complexity reduction by a factor of three in the CSI-based setting and by two orders of magnitude in the location-based configuration, the latter benefiting from the lower dimensionality of user reports. We show that both DMHSA models maintain high estimation accuracy, with the root mean squared error typically below 1 dB with priority-queuing-based scheduled users. These results enable the integration of DMHSA-based estimators into scheduling procedures, allowing the evaluation of multiple candidate user groups and the selection of those offering the highest average SINR and capacity."}

However, the efficient training of collective robots using multi-agent RL and the transfer of learned policies to real-world applications remain open research questions. In this work, we first develop a comprehensive robotic system, including simulation, distributed learning framework, and physical robot components. We then propose and evaluate reinforcement learning techniques designed for efficient training of cooperative and competitive policies on this platform. To address the challenges of multi-agent sim-to-real transfer, we introduce Out of Distribution State Initialization (OODSI) to mitigate the impact of the sim-to-real gap. In the experiments, OODSI improves the Sim2Real performance by 20%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments with a multi-robot car competitive game and a cooperative task in real-world settings."}

However, this deepening trust introduces a novel attack surface: Agent-Mediated Deception (AMD), where compromised agents are weaponized against their human users. While extensive research focuses on agent-centric threats, human susceptibility to deception by a compromised agent remains unexplored. We present the first large-scale empirical study with 303 participants to measure human susceptibility to AMD. This is based on HAT-Lab (Human-Agent Trust Laboratory), a high-fidelity research platform we develop, featuring nine carefully crafted scenarios spanning everyday and professional domains (e.g., healthcare, software development, human resources). Our 10 key findings reveal significant vulnerabilities and provide future defense perspectives. Specifically, only 8.6% of participants perceive AMD attacks, while domain experts show increased susceptibility in certain scenarios. We identify six cognitive failure modes in users and find that their risk awareness often fails to translate to protective behavior. The defense analysis reveals that effective warnings should interrupt workflows with low verification costs. With experiential learning based on HAT-Lab, over 90% of users who perceive risks report increased caution against AMD. This work provides empirical evidence and a platform for human-centric agent security research."}

Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to automate interviewing, yet existing systems lack a principled mechanism for balancing systematic coverage of predefined topics with adaptive exploration, or the ability to pursue follow-ups, deep dives, and emergent themes that arise organically during conversation. In this work, we formulate adaptive semi-structured interviewing as an optimization problem over the interviewer's behavior. We define interview utility as a trade-off between coverage of a predefined interview topic guide, discovery of relevant emergent themes, and interview cost measured by length. Based on this formulation, we introduce SparkMe, a multi-agent LLM interviewer that performs deliberative planning via simulated conversation rollouts to select questions with high expected utility. We evaluate SparkMe through controlled experiments with LLM-based interviewees, showing that it achieves higher interview utility, improving topic guide coverage (+4.7% over the best baseline) and eliciting richer emergent insights while using fewer conversational turns than prior LLM interviewing approaches. We further validate SparkMe in a user study with 70 participants across 7 professions on the impact of AI on their workflows. Domain experts rate SparkMe as producing high-quality adaptive interviews that surface helpful profession-specific insights not captured by prior approaches. The code, datasets, and evaluation protocols for SparkMe are available as open-source at https://github.com/SALT-NLP/SparkMe."}

Traditional qualitative coding frameworks are labor intensive and do not scale to large volumes of patient-authored messages across health systems. Existing machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) approaches provide partial solutions but often treat patient-centered communication (PCC) and SDoH as separate tasks or rely on models not well suited to patient-facing language. We introduce PVminer, a domain-adapted NLP framework for structuring patient voice in secure patient-provider communication. PVminer formulates PV detection as a multi-label, multi-class prediction task integrating patient-specific BERT encoders (PV-BERT-base and PV-BERT-large), unsupervised topic modeling for thematic augmentation (PV-Topic-BERT), and fine-tuned classifiers for Code, Subcode, and Combo-level labels. Topic representations are incorporated during fine-tuning and inference to enrich semantic inputs. PVminer achieves strong performance across hierarchical tasks and outperforms biomedical and clinical pre-trained baselines, achieving F1 scores of 82.25% (Code), 80.14% (Subcode), and up to 77.87% (Combo). An ablation study further shows that author identity and topic-based augmentation each contribute meaningful gains. Pre-trained models, source code, and documentation will be publicly released, with annotated datasets available upon request for research use."}

Yet widely used path planning methods such as sampling and trajectory optimization do not exploit this explicit connectivity information, and search-based methods such as A* suffer from scalability issues in large-scale high-resolution maps. In many applications, Euclidean shortest paths form the underpinning of the navigation system. For such applications, any-angle planning methods, which find optimal paths by connecting corners of obstacles with straight-line segments, provide a simple and efficient solution. In this paper, we present a method that has the optimality and completeness properties of any-angle planners while overcoming computational tractability issues common to search-based methods by exploiting multi-resolution representations. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic environments demonstrate the proposed approach's solution quality and speed, outperforming even sampling-based methods. The framework is open-sourced to allow the robotics and planning community to build on our research."}

Conventional models often act as opaque ''black boxes'' and fail to quantify the complex, irregular tumor boundaries that characterize malignant growth. To address these challenges, we present XMorph, an explainable and computationally efficient framework for fine-grained classification of three prominent brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. We propose an Information-Weighted Boundary Normalization (IWBN) mechanism that emphasizes diagnostically relevant boundary regions alongside nonlinear chaotic and clinically validated features, enabling a richer morphological representation of tumor growth. A dual-channel explainable AI module combines GradCAM++ visual cues with LLM-generated textual rationales, translating model reasoning into clinically interpretable insights. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 96.0%, demonstrating that explainability and high performance can co-exist in AI-based medical imaging systems.

It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks."}

Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: \\textit{reflection-in-action}, where the agent uses test-time scaling to generate and score multiple candidate actions using internal reflections before execution; and \\textit{reflection-on-action}, which uses test-time training to update both its internal reflection model and its action policy based on external reflections after execution. We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. Qualitative analyses, including real-robot trials, highlight behavioral correction through reflection."}

However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that a broad class of TTT architectures can be expressed as a form of learned linear attention operator. Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity."}
