In\nour approach, images, after being flattened into one-dimensional signals, are\nreconstructed as linear combinations of a set of learned spectral basis\nfunctions, where each basis is explicitly parameterized in terms of frequency,\nphase, and amplitude. The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary\nwith time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify\nthe contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple\nprobabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the\ndeterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This\nframework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly\ninterpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods\nrelying on stochastic inference or adversarial training. Moreover, the\nincorporation of frequency-domain loss functions, computed via the short-time\nFourier transform (STFT), ensures that the synthesized images capture both\nglobal structure and fine-grained spectral details, such as texture and edge\ninformation. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrate\nthat our approach not only achieves competitive performance in terms of\nreconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity but also offers improved\ntraining stability and computational efficiency. This new type of generative\nmodel opens up promising avenues for controlled synthesis, as the learned\nspectral dictionary affords a direct handle on the intrinsic frequency content\nof the images, thus providing enhanced interpretability and potential for novel\napplications in image manipulation and analysis."}

However, these videos present a challenge to\nexisting pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift\naccumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting,\nwhich maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable\nnovel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this,\nwe propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically\ndesigned for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses\nusing Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in\neach video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal\nconsistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced\nthe requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose\nestimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g.\nDINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering\nenhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian\nsplatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features,\nSmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature\ncorrespondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of\nSmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves\nimpressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and\nDORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

Experimental results demonstrated\nthat our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion,\nfeature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies,\nproviding valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data\nfor RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost\nlandforms and their environmental implications."}

Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current\nhallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments,\ntake an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with\nparameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with\nGPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem\nto reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These\nfindings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify\nhallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them."}

Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of\nlearned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable\nperformance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using\nself-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then\napplied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven\nto be effective to obtain representations that captures global context\ninformation. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to\nreconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for\nvarious applications.

HRScene is collected and re-annotated by 10 graduate-level annotators,\ncovering 25 scenarios, ranging from microscopic to radiology images, street\nviews, long-range pictures, and telescope images. It includes HRIs of\nreal-world objects, scanned documents, and composite multi-image. The two\ndiagnostic evaluation datasets are synthesized by combining the target image\nwith the gold answer and distracting images in different orders, assessing how\nwell models utilize regions in HRI. We conduct extensive experiments involving\n28 VLMs, including Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o. Experiments on HRScene show\nthat current VLMs achieve an average accuracy of around 50% on real-world\ntasks, revealing significant gaps in HRI understanding. Results on synthetic\ndatasets reveal that VLMs struggle to effectively utilize HRI regions, showing\nsignificant Regional Divergence and lost-in-middle, shedding light on future\nresearch."}

However, existing ergodic coverage methods are\nconstrained by the limited set of ergodic metrics available for control\nsynthesis, fundamentally limiting their performance. In this work, we propose\nan alternative approach to ergodic coverage based on flow matching, a technique\nwidely used in generative inference for efficient and scalable sampling. We\nformally derive the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage and show that it\nis equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator problem with a closed-form\nsolution. Our formulation enables alternative ergodic metrics from generative\ninference that overcome the limitations of existing ones. These metrics were\npreviously infeasible for control synthesis but can now be supported with no\ncomputational overhead. Specifically, flow matching with the Stein variational\ngradient flow enables control synthesis directly over the score function of the\ntarget distribution, improving robustness to the unnormalized distributions; on\nthe other hand, flow matching with the Sinkhorn divergence flow enables an\noptimal transport-based ergodic metric, improving coverage performance on\nnon-smooth distributions with irregular supports. We validate the improved\nperformance and competitive computational efficiency of our method through\ncomprehensive numerical benchmarks and across different nonlinear dynamics.

In-context learning\n(ICL), widely used in natural language processing, leverages these models by\nproviding task-specific prompts without modifying their parameters. This\nparadigm is increasingly being adapted for computer vision, where models\nreceive an input-output image pair, known as an in-context pair, alongside a\nquery image to illustrate the desired output. However, the success of visual\nICL largely hinges on the quality of these prompts. To address this, we propose\nEnhanced Instruct Me More (E-InMeMo), a novel approach that incorporates\nlearnable perturbations into in-context pairs to optimize prompting. Through\nextensive experiments on standard vision tasks, E-InMeMo demonstrates superior\nperformance over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Our core\ncontribution is an adversarial corpus attack that is fast and effective.

Unlike existing works that rarely take both problems\ninto account, this work considers both and provides an effective solution using\nrecent advances in large language models (LLMs). Our key observation is that\nnetwork protocols are often released with structured specification documents,\na.k.a. RFC documents, which can be systematically translated to formal protocol\nmessage specifications via LLMs. Such specifications, which may contain errors\ndue to the hallucination of LLMs, are used as a quasi-oracle to validate\nprotocol parsers, while the validation results in return gradually refine the\noracle. Since the oracle is derived from the document, any bugs we find in a\nprotocol implementation can be traced back to the document, thus addressing the\ntraceability problem. We have extensively evaluated our approach using nine\nnetwork protocols and their implementations written in C, Python, and Go.

In this\nstudy, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators\n(Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural\nOperator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1)\ndiscontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary\nconditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.\n  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios\nwith fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in\ncomplex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary\nconditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The\npredicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total\nvariation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is\nsimilar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce\nartificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves\nin hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator\narchitectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their\nability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also\nraise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where\nshock preservation is essential."}

The ablation study shows\nthat both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the\nunseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low\nnMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation.\nTract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white\nmatter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis\nacross datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future\nlarge-scale white matter shape analysis."}

As any visual changes in the scene\nproduce event data, it is paramount to classify the data into different motions\n(i.e., motion segmentation), which is useful for various tasks such as object\ndetection and visual servoing. We propose an iterative motion segmentation\nmethod, by classifying events into background (e.g., dominant motion\nhypothesis) and foreground (independent motion residuals), thus extending the\nContrast Maximization framework.

A key challenge\nis refining dynamics models, essential for planning and control, while\naddressing issues such as safe adaptation, catastrophic forgetting, outlier\nmanagement, data efficiency, and balancing exploration with exploitation -- all\nwithin task and onboard resource constraints. Towards this goal, we introduce a\ngenerative framework leveraging flow matching for online robot dynamics model\nalignment. Rather than executing actions based on a misaligned model, our\napproach refines planned actions to better match with those the robot would\ntake if its model was well aligned. We find that by transforming the actions\nthemselves rather than exploring with a misaligned model -- as is traditionally\ndone -- the robot collects informative data more efficiently, thereby\naccelerating learning. Moreover, we validate that the method can handle an\nevolving and possibly imperfect model while reducing, if desired, the\ndependency on replay buffers or legacy model snapshots. We validate our\napproach using two platforms: an unmanned ground vehicle and a quadrotor.

We here propose an\ninference attack framework against fixed aggregate statistics and an attribute\ninference attack called DeSIA.

However, policies trained on\nfinite datasets often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution.\nIn this work, we present a unified perspective on the generalization capability\nof imitation learning, grounded in both information theorey and data\ndistribution property. We first show that the generalization gap can be upper\nbounded by (i) the conditional information bottleneck on intermediate\nrepresentations and (ii) the mutual information between the model parameters\nand the training dataset. This characterization provides theoretical guidance\nfor designing effective training strategies in imitation learning, particularly\nin determining whether to freeze, fine-tune, or train large pretrained encoders\n(e.g., vision-language models or vision foundation models) from scratch to\nachieve better generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high\nconditional entropy from input to output induces a flatter likelihood\nlandscape, thereby reducing the upper bound on the generalization gap. In\naddition, it shortens the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) escape time from\nsharp local minima, which may increase the likelihood of reaching global optima\nunder fixed optimization budgets. These insights explain why imitation learning\noften exhibits limited generalization and underscore the importance of not only\nscaling the diversity of input data but also enriching the variability of\noutput labels conditioned on the same input."}
