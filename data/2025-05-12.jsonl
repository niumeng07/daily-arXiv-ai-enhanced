While benchmarks have been the primary method for\nestimating model capabilities, they often fail to establish true upper bounds\nor predict deployment behavior. This literature review consolidates the rapidly\nevolving field of AI safety evaluations, proposing a systematic taxonomy around\nthree dimensions: what properties we measure, how we measure them, and how\nthese measurements integrate into frameworks. We show how evaluations go beyond\nbenchmarks by measuring what models can do when pushed to the limit\n(capabilities), the behavioral tendencies exhibited by default (propensities),\nand whether our safety measures remain effective even when faced with\nsubversive adversarial AI (control). These properties are measured through\nbehavioral techniques like scaffolding, red teaming and supervised fine-tuning,\nalongside internal techniques such as representation analysis and mechanistic\ninterpretability. We provide deeper explanations of some safety-critical\ncapabilities like cybersecurity exploitation, deception, autonomous\nreplication, and situational awareness, alongside concerning propensities like\npower-seeking and scheming. The review explores how these evaluation methods\nintegrate into governance frameworks to translate results into concrete\ndevelopment decisions. We also highlight challenges to safety evaluations -\nproving absence of capabilities, potential model sandbagging, and incentives\nfor \"safetywashing\" - while identifying promising research directions.

We design continuous latent action models\n(CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to\nsolve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a)\nusing continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and\n(b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space\ncan be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples.\nImportantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data,\nenabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled\nexpert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl\n(locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot\narm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods,\nremarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best\nbaseline.

A further challenge with lip segmentation is its\nreliance on image quality , lighting, and skin tone, leading to inaccuracies in\nthe detected boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a sequential\nlip segmentation method that integrates attention UNet and multidimensional\ninput. We unravel the micro-patterns in facial images using local binary\npatterns to build multidimensional inputs. Subsequently, the multidimensional\ninputs are fed into sequential attention UNets, where the lip contour is\nreconstructed. We introduce a mask generation method that uses a few anatomical\nlandmarks and estimates the complete lip contour to improve segmentation\naccuracy.

Instead, global\ninformation is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading\nto a disconnect between local and global features.

However, effectively adapting such models for medical image\nclassification is still a less explored topic. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew framework to adapt SAM for medical image classification. First, we utilize\nthe SAM image encoder as a feature extractor to capture segmentation-based\nfeatures that convey important spatial and contextual details of the image,\nwhile freezing its weights to avoid unnecessary overhead during training. Next,\nwe propose a novel Spatially Localized Channel Attention (SLCA) mechanism to\ncompute spatially localized attention weights for the feature maps. The\nfeatures extracted from SAM's image encoder are processed through SLCA to\ncompute attention weights, which are then integrated into deep learning\nclassification models to enhance their focus on spatially relevant or\nmeaningful regions of the image, thus improving classification performance.\nExperimental results on three public medical image classification datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and data-efficiency of our approach."}

The most\ncommon modeling approach is to represent the continuous image as a linear\ncombination of shifted \"voxel\" basis functions. Although well-studied and\nwidely-deployed, this voxel-based model is associated with longstanding\nlimitations, including high computational costs, slow convergence, and a\npropensity for artifacts. In this work, we reexamine this model from a fresh\nperspective, identifying new issues that may have been previously overlooked\n(including undesirable approximation, periodicity, and nullspace\ncharacteristics). Our insights motivate us to propose a new model that is more\nresilient to the limitations (old and new) of the previous approach.\nSpecifically, the new model is based on a Fourier-domain basis expansion rather\nthan the standard image-domain voxel-based approach.

To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid\nlearning, a novel two-stage training framework that combines self-supervised\nand supervised learning for robust image reconstruction.\n  Methods: Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the\nfirst stage, self-supervised learning is employed to generate improved images\nfrom noisy or undersampled reference data. These enhanced images then serve as\npseudo-ground truths for the second stage, which uses supervised learning to\nrefine reconstruction performance and support higher acceleration rates.

The key to enabling efficient sensorimotor learning lies in\nleveraging regular patterns that exist in limited amounts of demonstration\ndata. These patterns, referred to as ``regularity,'' enable the data-efficient\nlearning of generalizable manipulation skills. This dissertation offers a new\nperspective on formulating manipulation problems through the lens of\nregularity.

Second, we introduce methods that\nconstitute robots' spatial understanding, unlocking their ability to imitate\nmanipulation skills from in-the-wild video observations.

As\nthe breast is highly radiosensitive, dose reduction is particularly important.\nPhase-contrast computed tomography (PCT) has been shown to produce\nhigher-quality images at lower doses and has no need for breast compression. It\nis demonstrated in the present study that, when imaging full fresh mastectomy\nsamples with PCT, deep learning-based image denoising can further reduce the\nradiation dose by a factor of 16 or more, without any loss of image quality.\nThe image quality has been assessed both in terms of objective metrics, such as\nspatial resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio, as well as in an observer study\nby experienced medical imaging specialists and radiologists. This work was\ncarried out in preparation for live patient PCT breast cancer imaging,\ninitially at specialized synchrotron facilities."}
