Despite promising progress, most SEMMD methods follow a two-step\nimage decomposition pipeline, which first reconstructs monochromatic CT images\nusing algorithms such as FBP, and then performs decomposition on these images.\nThe initial reconstruction step, however, neglects the energy-dependent\nattenuation of human tissues, introducing severe nonlinear beam hardening\nartifacts and noise into the subsequent decomposition.

This paper investigates the influence of\nexisting causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global\nfeature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations\nbetween fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in\nclassifying tail classes with similar visual appearance.

Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual\ndata have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks,\nintroducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies\nprimarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the\nelaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these\napproaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain\nexpertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented\nPlanning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation\ncapabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the\nStrategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we\nconstruct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome\npair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP\ndynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by\nsearching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating\nstrategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental\nresults show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it\nto perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent\nstrategies but also against novel, unseen strategies.

To this end, we build the thermal dataset for\npeople with mobility restrictions (TD4PWMR), designed to capture diverse\npedestrian scenarios, particularly focusing on individuals with mobility aids\nor mobility burden under varying environmental conditions, such as different\nlighting, weather, and crowded urban settings. While thermal imaging offers\nadvantages in terms of privacy and robustness to adverse conditions, it also\nintroduces inherent hurdles for object detection due to its lack of color and\nfine texture details and generally lower resolution of thermal images. To\novercome these limitations, we develop YOLO-Thermal, a novel variant of the\nYOLO architecture that integrates advanced feature extraction and attention\nmechanisms for enhanced detection accuracy and robustness in thermal imaging.\nExperiments demonstrate that the proposed thermal detector outperforms existing\ndetectors, while the proposed traffic light system effectively enhances\nbarrier-free intersection.

By masking\ninput images with inverted CAMs, the feature representations of ID data undergo\nmore substantial changes compared to those of OOD data, offering a robust\ncriterion for differentiation. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised\nOOD detection framework, Multi-Exit Class Activation Map (MECAM), which\nleverages multi-exit CAMs and feature masking. By utilizing mult-exit networks\nthat combine CAMs from varying resolutions and depths, our method captures both\nglobal and local feature representations, thereby enhancing the robustness of\nOOD detection. We evaluate MECAM on multiple ID datasets, including ISIC19 and\nPathMNIST, and test its performance against three medical OOD datasets, RSNA\nPneumonia, COVID-19, and HeadCT, and one natural image OOD dataset, iSUN.\nComprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art OOD detection methods validate\nthe effectiveness of our approach. Our findings emphasize the potential of\nmulti-exit networks and feature masking for advancing unsupervised OOD\ndetection in medical imaging, paving the way for more reliable and\ninterpretable models in clinical practice."}

In this work, we introduce the novel concept of XAI\nconsistency, defined as the agreement among different feature attribution\nmethods, and propose new metrics to quantify it. For the first time, we\nintegrate XAI consistency directly into the hyperparameter tuning objective,\ncreating a multi-objective optimization framework that balances predictive\nperformance with explanation robustness. Implemented within the Sequential\nParameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT), our approach uses both weighted\naggregation and desirability-based strategies to guide model selection. Through\nour proposed framework and supporting tools, we explore the impact of\nincorporating XAI consistency into the optimization process. This enables us to\ncharacterize distinct regions in the architecture configuration space: one\nregion with poor performance and comparatively low interpretability, another\nwith strong predictive performance but weak interpretability due to low\n\\gls{xai} consistency, and a trade-off region that balances both objectives by\noffering high interpretability alongside competitive performance.

Furthermore, we introduce implicit neural\nrepresentation (INR) as an unsupervised deep learning solver for representing\nthe underlying material maps. The inductive bias of INR toward continuous image\npatterns constrains the solution space and further enhances estimation quality.\nExtensive experiments on both simulated and real CT datasets show that JSover\noutperforms state-of-the-art SEMMD methods in accuracy and computational\nefficiency."}

The\nproposed high-order regularization (HR) provides new insight into\nregularization, which is widely used to train a neural network that can be\nutilized to approximate the action-value function in general reinforcement\nlearning problems. The proposed HR method ensures the provable convergence of\nthe approximation algorithm, which makes the much-needed connection between\nregularization and explainable learning using neural networks. The proposed HR\nmethod theoretically demonstrates that regularization can be regarded as an\napproximation in terms of inverse mapping with explicitly calculable\napproximation error, and the $L_2$ regularization is a lower-order case of the\nproposed method. We provide lower and upper bounds for the error of the\nproposed HR solution, which helps build a reliable model. We also find that\nregularization with the proposed HR can be regarded as a contraction. We prove\nthat the generalizability of neural networks can be maximized with a proper\nregularization matrix, and the proposed HR is applicable for neural networks\nwith any mapping matrix. With the theoretical explanation of the extreme\nlearning machine for neural network training and the proposed high-order\nregularization, one can better interpret the output of the neural network, thus\nleading to explainable learning. We present a case study based on regularized\nextreme learning neural networks to demonstrate the application of the proposed\nHR and give the corresponding incremental HR solution. We verify the\nperformance of the proposed HR method by solving a classic control problem in\nreinforcement learning.
